# Context Optimization Techniques

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/context-optimization` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Context Optimization Techniques Context optimization extends the effective capacity of limited context windows through strategic compression, masking, caching, and partitioning. The goal is not to magically increase context windows but to make better use of available capacity. Effective optimization can double or triple effective context capacity without requiring larger models or longer contexts.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Concepts, Detailed Topics, Practical Guidance, Integration, Skill Metadata, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Context limits constrain task complexity
- Optimizing for cost reduction (fewer tokens = lower costs)
- Reducing latency for long conversations
- Implementing long-running agent systems
- Needing to handle larger documents or conversations
- Building production systems at scale

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Concepts

Context optimization extends effective capacity through four primary strategies: compaction (summarizing context near limits), observation masking (replacing verbose outputs with references), KV-cache optimization (reusing cached computations), and context partitioning (splitting work across isolated contexts).

The key insight is that context quality matters more than quantity. Optimization preserves signal while reducing noise. The art lies in selecting what to keep versus what to discard, and when to apply each technique.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @context-optimization-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @context-optimization-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @context-optimization-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @context-optimization-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

**Example 1: Compaction Trigger**
```python
if context_tokens / context_limit > 0.8:
    context = compact_context(context)
```

**Example 2: Observation Masking**
```python
if len(observation) > max_length:
    ref_id = store_observation(observation)
    return f"[Obs:{ref_id} elided. Key: {extract_key(observation)}]"
```

**Example 3: Cache-Friendly Ordering**
```python
# Stable content first
context = [system_prompt, tool_definitions]  # Cacheable
context += [reused_templates]  # Reusable
context += [unique_content]  # Unique
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Measure before optimizing—know your current state
- Apply compaction before masking when possible
- Design for cache stability with consistent prompts
- Partition before context becomes problematic
- Monitor optimization effectiveness over time
- Balance token savings against quality preservation
- Test optimization at production scale

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/context-optimization`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Detailed Topics

### Compaction Strategies

**What is Compaction**
Compaction is the practice of summarizing context contents when approaching limits, then reinitializing a new context window with the summary. This distills the contents of a context window in a high-fidelity manner, enabling the agent to continue with minimal performance degradation.

Compaction typically serves as the first lever in context optimization. The art lies in selecting what to keep versus what to discard.

**Compaction Implementation**
Compaction works by identifying sections that can be compressed, generating summaries that capture essential points, and replacing full content with summaries. Priority for compression goes to tool outputs (replace with summaries), old turns (summarize early conversation), retrieved docs (summarize if recent versions exist), and never compress system prompt.

**Summary Generation**
Effective summaries preserve different elements depending on message type:

Tool outputs: Preserve key findings, metrics, and conclusions. Remove verbose raw output.

Conversational turns: Preserve key decisions, commitments, and context shifts. Remove filler and back-and-forth.

Retrieved documents: Preserve key facts and claims. Remove supporting evidence and elaboration.

### Observation Masking

**The Observation Problem**
Tool outputs can comprise 80%+ of token usage in agent trajectories. Much of this is verbose output that has already served its purpose. Once an agent has used a tool output to make a decision, keeping the full output provides diminishing value while consuming significant context.

Observation masking replaces verbose tool outputs with compact references. The information remains accessible if needed but does not consume context continuously.

**Masking Strategy Selection**
Not all observations should be masked equally:

Never mask: Observations critical to current task, observations from the most recent turn, observations used in active reasoning.

Consider masking: Observations from 3+ turns ago, verbose outputs with key points extractable, observations whose purpose has been served.

Always mask: Repeated outputs, boilerplate headers/footers, outputs already summarized in conversation.

### KV-Cache Optimization

**Understanding KV-Cache**
The KV-cache stores Key and Value tensors computed during inference, growing linearly with sequence length. Caching the KV-cache across requests sharing identical prefixes avoids recomputation.

Prefix caching reuses KV blocks across requests with identical prefixes using hash-based block matching. This dramatically reduces cost and latency for requests with common prefixes like system prompts.

**Cache Optimization Patterns**
Optimize for caching by reordering context elements to maximize cache hits. Place stable elements first (system prompt, tool definitions), then frequently reused elements, then unique elements last.

Design prompts to maximize cache stability: avoid dynamic content like timestamps, use consistent formatting, keep structure stable across sessions.

### Context Partitioning

**Sub-Agent Partitioning**
The most aggressive form of context optimization is partitioning work across sub-agents with isolated contexts. Each sub-agent operates in a clean context focused on its subtask without carrying accumulated context from other subtasks.

This approach achieves separation of concerns—the detailed search context remains isolated within sub-agents while the coordinator focuses on synthesis and analysis.

**Result Aggregation**
Aggregate results from partitioned subtasks by validating all partitions completed, merging compatible results, and summarizing if still too large.

### Budget Management

**Context Budget Allocation**
Design explicit context budgets. Allocate tokens to categories: system prompt, tool definitions, retrieved docs, message history, and reserved buffer. Monitor usage against budget and trigger optimization when approaching limits.

**Trigger-Based Optimization**
Monitor signals for optimization triggers: token utilization above 80%, degradation indicators, and performance drops. Apply appropriate optimization techniques based on context composition.

#### Imported: Practical Guidance

### Optimization Decision Framework

When to optimize:
- Context utilization exceeds 70%
- Response quality degrades as conversations extend
- Costs increase due to long contexts
- Latency increases with conversation length

What to apply:
- Tool outputs dominate: observation masking
- Retrieved documents dominate: summarization or partitioning
- Message history dominates: compaction with summarization
- Multiple components: combine strategies

### Performance Considerations

Compaction should achieve 50-70% token reduction with less than 5% quality degradation. Masking should achieve 60-80% reduction in masked observations. Cache optimization should achieve 70%+ hit rate for stable workloads.

Monitor and iterate on optimization strategies based on measured effectiveness.
