# Multi-Agent Optimization Toolkit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Multi-Agent Optimization Toolkit

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Safety, Role: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Performance Engineering Specialist, Arguments Handling, 1. Multi-Agent Performance Profiling, 2. Context Window Optimization, 3. Agent Coordination Efficiency.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Improving multi-agent coordination, throughput, or latency
- Profiling agent workflows to identify bottlenecks
- Designing orchestration strategies for complex workflows
- Optimizing cost, context usage, or tool efficiency
- You only need to tune a single agent prompt
- There are no measurable metrics or evaluation data

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Establish baseline metrics and target performance goals.
2. Profile agent workloads and identify coordination bottlenecks.
3. Apply orchestration changes and cost controls incrementally.
4. Validate improvements with repeatable tests and rollbacks.
5. Initial performance profiling
6. Agent-based optimization
7. Cost and performance tracking

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

1. Establish baseline metrics and target performance goals.
2. Profile agent workloads and identify coordination bottlenecks.
3. Apply orchestration changes and cost controls incrementally.
4. Validate improvements with repeatable tests and rollbacks.

#### Imported: Reference Workflows

### Workflow 1: E-Commerce Platform Optimization

1. Initial performance profiling
2. Agent-based optimization
3. Cost and performance tracking
4. Continuous improvement cycle

### Workflow 2: Enterprise API Performance Enhancement

1. Comprehensive system analysis
2. Multi-layered agent optimization
3. Iterative performance refinement
4. Cost-efficient scaling strategy

#### Imported: Safety

- Avoid deploying orchestration changes without regression testing.
- Roll out changes gradually to prevent system-wide regressions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/agent-orchestration-multi-agent-optimize`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
