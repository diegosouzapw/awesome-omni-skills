# Create Branch

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/create-branch` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Create Branch Create a git branch with the correct type prefix and a descriptive name following Sentry conventions.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to create a new git branch that follows the repository's naming convention.
- You are starting a new piece of work from the default branch and need help classifying it as feat, fix, docs, or another branch type.
- You want the branch name proposed from either the task description or the current local diff.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Create a git branch following Sentry naming conventions. Use when asked to "create a branch", "new branch", "start a branch", "make a branch", "switch to a new branch", or when starting new work on the default branch.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Changes exist: read the diff content to understand what the work is about and generate a description.
2. No changes: ask the user what they are about to work on.
3. Type - Use when
4. feat - New user-facing functionality
5. fix - Broken behavior now works
6. ref - Same behavior, different structure
7. chore - Deps, config, version bumps, updating existing tooling — no new logic

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Step 1: Get the Username Prefix

Run `gh api user --jq .login` to get the GitHub username.

If the command fails (e.g. not authenticated), ask the user for their preferred prefix.

#### Imported: Step 2: Determine the Branch Description

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided**, use it as the description of the work.

**If no arguments**, check for local changes:

```bash
git diff
git diff --cached
git status --short
```

- **Changes exist**: read the diff content to understand what the work is about and generate a description.
- **No changes**: ask the user what they are about to work on.

#### Imported: Step 3: Classify the Type

Pick the type from this table based on the description:

| Type      | Use when                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`    | New user-facing functionality                                         |
| `fix`     | Broken behavior now works                                             |
| `ref`     | Same behavior, different structure                                    |
| `chore`   | Deps, config, version bumps, updating existing tooling — no new logic |
| `perf`    | Same behavior, faster                                                 |
| `style`   | CSS, formatting, visual-only                                          |
| `docs`    | Documentation only                                                    |
| `test`    | Tests only                                                            |
| `ci`      | CI/CD config                                                          |
| `build`   | Build system                                                          |
| `meta`    | Repo metadata changes                                                 |
| `license` | License changes                                                       |

When unsure: `feat` for new things (including new scripts, skills, or tools), `ref` for restructuring existing things, `chore` only when updating/maintaining something that already exists.

#### Imported: Step 4: Generate and Propose

Build the branch name as `<username>/<type>/<short-description>`.

Rules for `<short-description>`:

- Kebab-case, lowercase
- 3 to 6 words, concise but clear
- Describe the change, not file names
- Only use ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens — no spaces, dots, colons, tildes, or other git-forbidden characters

Present it to the user and ask if they want to use it, modify it, or change the type.

### Examples

| Work description                           | Branch name                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Dropdown menu not closing on outside click | `priscila/fix/dropdown-not-closing-on-blur` |
| Adding search to conversations page        | `priscila/feat/add-search-to-conversations` |
| Restructuring drawer components            | `priscila/ref/simplify-drawer-components`   |
| Updating test fixtures                     | `priscila/chore/update-test-fixtures`       |
| Bumping @sentry/react to latest version    | `priscila/chore/bump-sentry-react`          |
| Adding a new agent skill                   | `priscila/feat/add-create-branch-skill`     |

#### Imported: Step 5: Create the Branch

Once confirmed, detect the current and default branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git remote | grep -qx origin && echo origin || git remote | head -1
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/<remote>/||' | tr -d '[:space:]'
```

If `symbolic-ref` fails, fall back to `git branch --list main master`: use the one that exists; if both or neither exist, ask the user.

If `git branch --show-current` is empty (detached HEAD), show the current commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) and ask whether to branch from it or switch to the default branch first.

Otherwise, if the current branch is not the default branch, warn the user and ask whether to branch from the current branch or switch to the default branch first.

If the user wants to switch to the default branch, handle any uncommitted changes appropriately (offer to stash them if present), then run `git checkout <default-branch>`. On any failure, restore stashed changes if applicable and stop.

Before creating the branch, check that the name doesn't already exist locally or on the remote (`git show-ref`). If it does, ask the user to choose a different name.

Create the branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Restore any stashed changes after the branch is created.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @create-branch-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @create-branch-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @create-branch-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @create-branch-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/create-branch`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |
