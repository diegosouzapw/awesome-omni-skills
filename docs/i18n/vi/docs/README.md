## 📊 Status Snapshot

<!-- generated:docs-readme-status-snapshot:start -->
| Area | State | Details |
|:-----|:------|:--------|
| 🏗️ **Runtime** | ✅ Current | Unified CLI, Ink visual shell, API, MCP, and A2A all ship from the same package |
| 📦 **Catalog** | 📌 263 skills | 263 native catalog skills across 16 active categories, with 109 curated English derivatives in `skills_omni` and 7 fully backed bundles |
| 🎯 **Install** | ✅ Current | Guided TTY install, selective `--skill` and `--bundle`, custom path support, and discovery-driven install |
| 🌐 **API** | ✅ Current | Read-only registry API with auth, admin runtime, rate limiting, CORS/IP allowlists, maintenance mode, and downloads |
| 🔌 **MCP** | ✅ Current | `stdio` · `stream` · `sse`, local sidecar mode, 9 install-capable clients, 16 config-capable clients, 33 config targets, and 20 config profiles |
| 🤖 **A2A** | ✅ Current | Simple-first local runtime with JSON/SQLite durability, restart resume, SSE streaming, cancelation, external executor mode, and optional leased coordination when explicitly enabled |
| 🛡️ **Security** | ✅ Current | Static scanner, optional ClamAV/VirusTotal, signed release artifacts, archive checksums, and release-time verification |
| 📋 **Classification** | ✅ Current | Canonical taxonomy, maturity, semantic quality spread, best-practices spread, and security scoring |
| 📁 **Archives** | ✅ Current | Per-skill `.zip` and `.tar.gz` archives with SHA-256 checksum manifests |
| 🔐 **Signing** | ✅ Current | Detached signatures enforced on release tags; local install flows consume the same manifest and checksum metadata |
| 🧬 **Intake Flow** | ✅ Current | Native skills land under `skills/` through direct contributor PRs and reviewed repository-based external-import PRs; PR automation reviews them and proposes Omni-enhanced derivatives under `skills_omni/` |
<!-- generated:docs-readme-status-snapshot:end -->

## 🔭 Current Project State

The foundation track now lives in the active project state, and the second category-expansion wave is already in the catalog. The project should now be read as a working baseline with optional future expansion tracks:

<!-- generated:docs-readme-current-project-state:start -->
- public `v0.9.9` and private `v1.0.0` are the current stable release floor
- the catalog now covers 263 native skills across 16 active categories, with 217 passing validation cleanly and 46 currently in warning-grade native intake
- curated `skills_omni/` output remains a maintained English-only surface with 109 automation-managed derivatives
- protocol surfaces, release automation, and private enhancement automation are in service, not in bootstrap
- the private external-sync runtime is now actively proposing native intake through `external-import/*` PRs, using the same public validator and enhancer path as human-submitted native PRs
<!-- generated:docs-readme-current-project-state:end -->

Future expansion stays deliberate:

- deepen `design`, `tools`, `data-ai`, and `machine-learning`
- avoid reopening dormant non-code-native categories until the current code-native tracks have stronger depth
- keep the quality floor and enhancer review path intact while doing so

That expansion work is now reflected directly in the live catalog and architecture docs:

- the current catalog snapshot in [Catalog](CATALOG.md)
- the runtime and artifact shape in [Codebase Analysis](architecture/CODEBASE-ANALYSIS.md)
- the forward direction in [Agent-Native Roadmap](architecture/AGENT-NATIVE-ROADMAP.md)

## 🔀 Repository Surfaces

Awesome Omni Skills should be read as three connected surfaces:

| Surface | What it is | How it changes |
|:--------|:-----------|:---------------|
| 📥 `skills/` | Public native skill repository | Direct contributor PRs and reviewed repository-based external intake |
| ✨ `skills_omni/` | Curated improved best-practice derivative surface | Private enhancer companion PRs only |
| 🖥️ Runtime surfaces | CLI, API, MCP, and A2A over the same generated catalog | Build, validation, and release automation |

---

## 📌 Current Decisions

These architecture questions are no longer “open” in practice and are now treated as project decisions:

1. **Distribution stays manifest-first plus signed archives**
   The machine-readable manifest remains the contract consumed by CLI, API, MCP, and A2A. Signed per-skill archives are the download and release surface layered on top of that contract.
2. **Private or premium catalogs should reuse the same manifest schema**
   Auth and policy should be layered externally, not by forking the manifest or catalog shape.
3. **MCP config should converge on a few canonical export families**
   Awesome Omni Skills now standardizes around JSON `mcpServers`, JSON `servers`, JSON `context_servers`, YAML `mcpServers`, YAML `extensions`, and TOML `[mcp_servers]`, while keeping bespoke writers only where official client docs require a different structure.

Those decisions align with current official MCP and client documentation, including:

- official MCP Registry and extension support guidance at `modelcontextprotocol.io`
- OpenAI Docs MCP and Codex CLI docs at `developers.openai.com` and `platform.openai.com`
- VS Code MCP extension and product docs at `code.visualstudio.com`
- client docs for Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Junie, Kiro, OpenCode, Cline, Kilo Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Zed, Goose, Postman, and JetBrains AI Assistant

### 📁 Generated Artifacts

The build pipeline emits the machine-readable files that drive every runtime surface:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| `metadata.json` | Repository-wide validation and score summary |
| `skills_index.json` | Repo-local normalized skill index |
| `dist/catalog.json` | Published catalog for search and listing |
| `dist/bundles.json` | Bundle definitions with availability |
| `dist/manifests/<skill>.json` | Per-skill machine-readable manifest |
| `dist/archives/<skill>.zip` | Skill archive (zip) |
| `dist/archives/<skill>.tar.gz` | Skill archive (tarball) |
| `dist/archives/<skill>.checksums.txt` | SHA-256 checksum manifest |

`dist/` stays committed on purpose. These generated artifacts are part of the install, API, MCP, A2A, smoke, and release contract.

### 🌐 API

```bash
npx awesome-omni-skills api --port 3333
```

Read-only registry API for skills, bundles, comparison, install planning, and artifact downloads.

### 🔌 MCP

```bash
npx awesome-omni-skills mcp stdio
npx awesome-omni-skills mcp stream
npx awesome-omni-skills mcp sse
npx awesome-omni-skills mcp stream --local
```

The local sidecar now supports first-class MCP config writing for:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- VS Code and Dev Containers
- Gemini CLI
- Antigravity
- Kiro
- Codex CLI
- Continue
- Windsurf
- OpenCode
- Cline
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- Kilo Code
- Zed
- Goose

### 🤖 A2A

```bash
npx awesome-omni-skills a2a --port 3335
```

Task lifecycle, streaming, persistence, restart recovery, and simple-first local orchestration. Shared leased execution is available when explicitly enabled; Redis remains an advanced hosted option, not the default local path.
