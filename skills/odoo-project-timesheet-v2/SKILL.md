# Odoo Project & Timesheet

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-project-timesheet` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Odoo Project & Timesheet

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Setting up a new project with tasks, deadlines, and team assignments.
- Configuring billable vs. non-billable time tracking per project.
- Creating a timesheet approval workflow for managers.
- Invoicing customers based on logged hours (Time & Materials billing).
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Expert guide for Odoo Project and Timesheets: task stages, billable time tracking, timesheet approval, budget alerts, and invoicing from timesheets.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

This skill helps you configure Odoo Project and Timesheets for service businesses, agencies, and consulting firms. It covers project setup with budgets, task stage management, employee timesheet logging, approval workflows, and converting approved timesheet hours to customer invoices.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-project-timesheet` and describe your project or billing scenario.
2. **Configure**: Receive step-by-step setup instructions.
3. **Automate**: Get guidance on automatically generating invoices from approved timesheets.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @odoo-project-timesheet-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-project-timesheet-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-project-timesheet-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @odoo-project-timesheet-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Create a Billable Project

```text
Menu: Project → New Project (or the "+" button in Project view)

Name:     Website Redesign — Acme Corp
Customer: Acme Corporation
Billable: YES  (toggle ON)

Settings tab:
  Billing Type: Based on Timesheets (Time & Materials)
  Service Product: Consulting Hours ($150/hr)
  ☑ Timesheets
  ☑ Task Dependencies
  ☑ Subtasks

Budget:
  Planned Hours: 120 hours
  Budget Alert: at 80% (96 hrs) → notify project manager
```

### Example 2: Log Time on a Task

```text
Method A — Directly inside the Task (recommended for accuracy):
  Open Task → Timesheets tab → Add a Line
  Employee:    John Doe
  Date:        Today
  Description: "Initial wireframes and site map" (required for clear invoices)
  Duration:    3:30  (3 hours 30 minutes)

Method B — Timesheets app (for end-of-day bulk entry):
  Menu: Timesheets → My Timesheets → New
  Project:  Website Redesign
  Task:     Wireframe Design
  Duration: 3:30
```

### Example 3: Enable Timesheet Approval Before Invoicing

```text
Menu: Timesheets → Configuration → Settings
  ☑ Timesheet Approval  (employees submit; managers approve)

Approval flow:
  1. Employee submits timesheet at week/month end
  2. Manager reviews: Timesheets → Managers → Timesheets to Approve
  3. Manager clicks "Approve" → entries are locked and billable
  4. Only approved entries flow into the invoice

If Approval is disabled, all logged hours are immediately billable.
```

### Example 4: Invoice from Timesheets

```text
Step 1: Verify approved hours
  Menu: Timesheets → Managers → All Timesheets
  Filter: Billable = YES, Timesheet Invoice State = "To Invoice"

Step 2: Generate Invoice
  Menu: Sales → Orders → To Invoice → Timesheets  (v15/v16)
  or:   Accounting → Customers → Invoiceable Time  (v17)
  Filter by Customer: Acme Corporation
  Select entries → Create Invoices

Step 3: Invoice pre-populates with:
  Product: Consulting Hours
  Quantity: Sum of approved hours
  Unit Price: $150.00
  Total: Calculated automatically
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ✅ Do: Enable Timesheet Approval so only manager-approved hours appear on customer invoices.
- ✅ Do: Set a budget alert at 80% of planned hours so PMs can intervene before overruns.
- ✅ Do: Require timesheet descriptions — vague entries like "Work done" on invoices destroy client trust.
- ✅ Do: Use Subtasks to break work into granular pieces while keeping the parent task on the Kanban board.
- ❌ Don't: Mix billable and internal projects without tagging — it corrupts profitability and utilization reports.
- ❌ Don't: Log time on the Project itself (without a Task) — it cannot be reported at the task level.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-project-timesheet`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Limitations

- **Timesheet Approval** is an Enterprise-only feature in some Odoo versions — verify your plan includes it.
- Does not cover **Project Forecast** (resource capacity planning) — that requires the Enterprise Forecast app.
- **Time & Materials** invoicing works well for hourly billing but is not suited for **fixed-price projects** — use milestones or manual invoice lines for those.
- Timesheet entries logged outside an active project-task pair (e.g., on internal projects) are not assignable to customer invoices without custom configuration.
