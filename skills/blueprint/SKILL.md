# Blueprint — Construction Plan Generator

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/blueprint` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Blueprint — Construction Plan Generator Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step plan any coding agent can execute cold.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Key Differentiators, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the task requires multiple PRs or sessions
- Use when multiple agents or team members need to share execution
- Use when you want adversarial review of the plan before execution
- Use when parallel step detection and dependency graphs matter
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step construction plan any coding agent can execute cold. Each step has a self-contained context brief — a fresh agent in a new session can pick up any step without reading....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. bash mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills git clone https://github.com/antbotlab/blueprint.git ~/.claude/skills/blueprint
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/antbotlab/blueprint.git ~/.claude/skills/blueprint
```

#### Imported: Overview

Blueprint is for multi-session, multi-agent engineering projects where each step must be independently executable by a fresh agent that has never seen the conversation history. Install it once, invoke it with `/blueprint <project> <objective>`.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Research** — Scans the codebase, reads project memory, runs pre-flight checks
2. **Design** — Breaks the objective into one-PR-sized steps, identifies parallelism, assigns model tiers
3. **Draft** — Generates the plan from a structured template with branch workflow rules, CI policy, and rollback strategies inline
4. **Review** — Delegates adversarial review to a strongest-model sub-agent (falls back to default model if unavailable)
5. **Register** — Saves the plan and updates project memory

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @blueprint to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @blueprint against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @blueprint for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @blueprint using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Database migration
```
/blueprint myapp "migrate database to PostgreSQL"
```

### Example 2: Plugin extraction
```
/blueprint antbot "extract providers into plugins"
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- ✅ Use for tasks requiring 3+ PRs or multiple sessions
- ✅ Let Blueprint auto-detect git/gh availability — it degrades gracefully
- ❌ Don't invoke for tasks completable in a single PR
- ❌ Don't invoke when the user says "just do it"
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/blueprint`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |

#### Imported: Key Differentiators

- **Cold-start execution**: Every step has a self-contained context brief
- **Adversarial review gate**: Strongest-model review before execution
- **Zero runtime risk**: Pure markdown — no hooks, no scripts, no executable code
- **Plan mutation protocol**: Steps can be split, inserted, skipped with audit trail

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
