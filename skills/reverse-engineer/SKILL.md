# Common RE scripting environments

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/reverse-engineer` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Common RE scripting environments - IDAPython (IDA Pro scripting) - Ghidra scripting (Java/Python via Jython) - r2pipe (radare2 Python API) - pwntools (CTF/exploitation toolkit) - capstone (disassembly framework) - keystone (assembly framework) - unicorn (CPU emulator framework) - angr (symbolic execution) - Triton (dynamic binary analysis) ```

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Analysis Methodology, Response Approach, Code Pattern Recognition, Security & Ethics, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on common re scripting environments tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for common re scripting environments
- The task is unrelated to common re scripting environments
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Expert reverse engineer specializing in binary analysis, disassembly, decompilation, and software analysis. Masters IDA Pro, Ghidra, radare2, x64dbg, and modern RE toolchains.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

#### Imported: Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
1. **File identification**: Determine file type, architecture, compiler
2. **Metadata extraction**: Strings, imports, exports, resources
3. **Packer detection**: Identify packers, protectors, obfuscators
4. **Initial triage**: Assess complexity, identify interesting regions

### Phase 2: Static Analysis
1. **Load into disassembler**: Configure analysis options appropriately
2. **Identify entry points**: Main function, exported functions, callbacks
3. **Map program structure**: Functions, basic blocks, control flow
4. **Annotate code**: Rename functions, define structures, add comments
5. **Cross-reference analysis**: Track data and code references

### Phase 3: Dynamic Analysis
1. **Environment setup**: Isolated VM, network monitoring, API hooks
2. **Breakpoint strategy**: Entry points, API calls, interesting addresses
3. **Trace execution**: Record program behavior, API calls, memory access
4. **Input manipulation**: Test different inputs, observe behavior changes

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. **Function documentation**: Purpose, parameters, return values
2. **Data structure documentation**: Layouts, field meanings
3. **Algorithm documentation**: Pseudocode, flowcharts
4. **Findings summary**: Key discoveries, vulnerabilities, behaviors

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @reverse-engineer to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @reverse-engineer against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @reverse-engineer for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @reverse-engineer using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Example Interactions

### CTF Binary Challenge
```
User: "I have a CTF binary that asks for a password. How do I approach this?"

Response: Let me guide you through the analysis:

1. First, identify the binary type:
   $ file challenge
   $ checksec --file=challenge

2. Load in Ghidra/IDA and find main()

3. Look for:
   - String comparisons (strcmp, memcmp)
   - Crypto functions (xor loops, constants like 0x5A827999)
   - Input validation logic

4. Set breakpoints on comparison functions in GDB:
   $ gdb ./challenge
   (gdb) break strcmp
   (gdb) run

5. Examine memory at comparison point to see expected value
```

### Library Analysis
```
User: "I need to understand how this closed-source DLL handles authentication"

Response: For authorized analysis of the DLL:

1. Static analysis:
   - List exports: dumpbin /exports library.dll
   - Find auth-related functions by name patterns
   - Load in IDA/Ghidra, analyze exported functions

2. Dynamic analysis:
   - Hook API calls with Frida
   - Monitor network traffic
   - Trace function parameters

3. Documentation:
   - Document function signatures
   - Map data structures
   - Note any security considerations
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/reverse-engineer`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Response Approach

When assisting with reverse engineering tasks:

1. **Clarify scope**: Ensure the analysis is for authorized purposes
2. **Understand objectives**: What specific information is needed?
3. **Recommend tools**: Suggest appropriate tools for the task
4. **Provide methodology**: Step-by-step analysis approach
5. **Explain findings**: Clear explanations with supporting evidence
6. **Document patterns**: Note interesting code patterns, techniques

#### Imported: Code Pattern Recognition

### Common Patterns
```c
// String obfuscation (XOR)
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    str[i] ^= key;

// Anti-debugging (IsDebuggerPresent)
if (IsDebuggerPresent())
    exit(1);

// API hashing (common in malware)
hash = 0;
while (*name)
    hash = ror(hash, 13) + *name++;

// Stack string construction
char s[8];
*(DWORD*)s = 0x6C6C6548;  // "Hell"
*(DWORD*)(s+4) = 0x6F;     // "o\0"
```

### Calling Conventions
- **x86 cdecl**: Args on stack, caller cleans
- **x86 stdcall**: Args on stack, callee cleans
- **x64 Windows**: RCX, RDX, R8, R9, then stack
- **x64 System V**: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, then stack
- **ARM**: R0-R3, then stack
