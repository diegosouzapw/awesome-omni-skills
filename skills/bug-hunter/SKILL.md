# Bug Hunter

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/bug-hunter` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Bug Hunter Systematically hunt down and fix bugs using proven debugging techniques. No guessing—follow the evidence.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Debugging Techniques, Common Bug Patterns, Debugging Tools, Documentation Template, Bug: Login timeout after 30 seconds, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User reports a bug or error
- Something isn't working as expected
- User says "fix the bug" or "debug this"
- Intermittent failures or weird behavior
- Production issues need investigation
- Take a break (seriously, walk away for 10 minutes)

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `README.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `README.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Get exact steps to reproduce
2. Try to reproduce locally
3. Note what triggers it
4. Document the error message/behavior
5. Check if it happens every time or randomly
6. What environment? (dev, staging, prod)
7. What browser/device?

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: The Debugging Process

### 1. Reproduce the Bug

First, make it happen consistently:

```
1. Get exact steps to reproduce
2. Try to reproduce locally
3. Note what triggers it
4. Document the error message/behavior
5. Check if it happens every time or randomly
```

If you can't reproduce it, gather more info:
- What environment? (dev, staging, prod)
- What browser/device?
- What user actions preceded it?
- Any error logs?

### 2. Gather Evidence

Collect all available information:

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Application logs
tail -f logs/app.log

# System logs
journalctl -u myapp -f

# Browser console
# Open DevTools → Console tab
```

**Check error messages:**
- Full stack trace
- Error type and message
- Line numbers
- Timestamp

**Check state:**
- What data was being processed?
- What was the user trying to do?
- What's in the database?
- What's in local storage/cookies?

### 3. Form a Hypothesis

Based on evidence, guess what's wrong:

```
"The login times out because the session cookie 
expires before the auth check completes"

"The form fails because email validation regex 
doesn't handle plus signs"

"The API returns 500 because the database query 
has a syntax error with special characters"
```

### 4. Test the Hypothesis

Prove or disprove your guess:

**Add logging:**
```javascript
console.log('Before API call:', userData);
const response = await api.login(userData);
console.log('After API call:', response);
```

**Use debugger:**
```javascript
debugger; // Execution pauses here
const result = processData(input);
```

**Isolate the problem:**
```javascript
// Comment out code to narrow down
// const result = complexFunction();
const result = { mock: 'data' }; // Use mock data
```

### 5. Find Root Cause

Trace back to the actual problem:

**Common root causes:**
- Null/undefined values
- Wrong data types
- Race conditions
- Missing error handling
- Incorrect logic
- Off-by-one errors
- Async/await issues
- Missing validation

**Example trace:**
```
Symptom: "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined"
↓
Where: user.profile.name
↓
Why: user.profile is undefined
↓
Why: API didn't return profile
↓
Why: User ID was null
↓
Root cause: Login didn't set user ID in session
```

### 6. Implement Fix

Fix the root cause, not the symptom:

**Bad fix (symptom):**
```javascript
// Just hide the error
const name = user?.profile?.name || 'Unknown';
```

**Good fix (root cause):**
```javascript
// Ensure user ID is set on login
const login = async (credentials) => {
  const user = await authenticate(credentials);
  if (user) {
    session.userId = user.id; // Fix: Set user ID
    return user;
  }
  throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
};
```

### 7. Test the Fix

Verify it actually works:

```
1. Reproduce the original bug
2. Apply the fix
3. Try to reproduce again (should fail)
4. Test edge cases
5. Test related functionality
6. Run existing tests
```

### 8. Prevent Regression

Add a test so it doesn't come back:

```javascript
test('login sets user ID in session', async () => {
  const user = await login({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'pass' });
  
  expect(session.userId).toBe(user.id);
  expect(session.userId).not.toBeNull();
});
```

#### Imported: Debugging Techniques

### Binary Search

Cut the problem space in half repeatedly:

```javascript
// Does the bug happen before or after this line?
console.log('CHECKPOINT 1');
// ... code ...
console.log('CHECKPOINT 2');
// ... code ...
console.log('CHECKPOINT 3');
```

### Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain the code line by line out loud. Often you'll spot the issue while explaining.

### Print Debugging

Strategic console.logs:

```javascript
console.log('Input:', input);
console.log('After transform:', transformed);
console.log('Before save:', data);
console.log('Result:', result);
```

### Diff Debugging

Compare working vs broken:
- What changed recently?
- What's different between environments?
- What's different in the data?

### Time Travel Debugging

Use git to find when it broke:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # Current commit is broken
git bisect good abc123  # This old commit worked
# Git will check out commits for you to test
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @bug-hunter to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @bug-hunter against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @bug-hunter for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @bug-hunter using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Reproduce first, fix second
- Follow the evidence, don't guess
- Fix root cause, not symptoms
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document what you learned
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/bug-hunter`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Common Bug Patterns

### Null/Undefined

```javascript
// Bug
const name = user.profile.name;

// Fix
const name = user?.profile?.name || 'Unknown';

// Better fix
if (!user || !user.profile) {
  throw new Error('User profile required');
}
const name = user.profile.name;
```

### Race Condition

```javascript
// Bug
let data = null;
fetchData().then(result => data = result);
console.log(data); // null - not loaded yet

// Fix
const data = await fetchData();
console.log(data); // correct value
```

### Off-by-One

```javascript
// Bug
for (let i = 0; i <= array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]); // undefined on last iteration
}

// Fix
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### Type Coercion

```javascript
// Bug
if (count == 0) { // true for "", [], null
  
// Fix
if (count === 0) { // only true for 0
```

### Async Without Await

```javascript
// Bug
const result = asyncFunction(); // Returns Promise
console.log(result.data); // undefined

// Fix
const result = await asyncFunction();
console.log(result.data); // correct value
```

#### Imported: Documentation Template

After fixing, document it:

```markdown

#### Imported: Bug: Login timeout after 30 seconds

**Symptom:** Users get logged out immediately after login

**Root Cause:** Session cookie expires before auth check completes

**Fix:** Increased session timeout from 30s to 3600s in config

**Files Changed:**
- config/session.js (line 12)

**Testing:** Verified login persists for 1 hour

**Prevention:** Added test for session persistence
```
