# macOS SwiftPM App Packaging (No Xcode)

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/macos-spm-app-packaging` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# macOS SwiftPM App Packaging (No Xcode)

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Validation Checkpoints, Templates, Notes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- When the user needs a SwiftPM-based macOS app without relying on an Xcode project.
- When you need packaging, signing, notarization, or appcast guidance for a SwiftPM app.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Scaffold, build, sign, and package SwiftPM macOS apps without Xcode projects.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Copy assets/templates/bootstrap/ into a new repo.
2. Rename MyApp in Package.swift, Sources/MyApp/, and version.env.
3. Customize APPNAME, BUNDLEID, and versions.
4. Copy scripts from assets/templates/ into your repo (for example, Scripts/).
5. Build/tests: swift build and swift test.
6. Package: Scripts/package_app.sh.
7. Run: Scripts/compileandrun.sh (preferred) or Scripts/launch.sh.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Two-Step Workflow

1) Bootstrap the project folder
   - Copy `assets/templates/bootstrap/` into a new repo.
   - Rename `MyApp` in `Package.swift`, `Sources/MyApp/`, and `version.env`.
   - Customize `APP_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID`, and versions.

2) Build, package, and run the bootstrapped app
   - Copy scripts from `assets/templates/` into your repo (for example, `Scripts/`).
   - Build/tests: `swift build` and `swift test`.
   - Package: `Scripts/package_app.sh`.
   - Run: `Scripts/compile_and_run.sh` (preferred) or `Scripts/launch.sh`.
   - Release (optional): `Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh` and `Scripts/make_appcast.sh`.
   - Tag + GitHub release (optional): create a git tag, upload the zip/appcast to the GitHub release, and publish.

#### Imported: Overview

Bootstrap a complete SwiftPM macOS app folder, then build, package, and run it without Xcode. Use `assets/templates/bootstrap/` for the starter layout and `references/packaging.md` + `references/release.md` for packaging and release details.

#### Imported: Validation Checkpoints

Run these after key steps to catch failures early before proceeding to the next stage.

**After packaging (`Scripts/package_app.sh`):**
```bash
# Confirm .app bundle structure is intact
ls -R build/HelloApp.app/Contents

# Check that the binary is present and executable
file build/HelloApp.app/Contents/MacOS/HelloApp
```

**After signing (`Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh` or ad-hoc dev signing):**
```bash
# Inspect signature and entitlements
codesign -dv --verbose=4 build/HelloApp.app

# Verify the bundle passes Gatekeeper checks locally
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose build/HelloApp.app
```

**After notarization and stapling:**
```bash
# Confirm the staple ticket is attached
stapler validate build/HelloApp.app

# Re-run Gatekeeper to confirm notarization is recognised
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose build/HelloApp.app
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @macos-spm-app-packaging to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/macos-spm-app-packaging/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/macos-spm-app-packaging/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @macos-spm-app-packaging using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Minimum End-to-End Example

Shortest path from bootstrap to a running app:
```bash
# 1. Copy and rename the skeleton
cp -R assets/templates/bootstrap/ ~/Projects/MyApp
cd ~/Projects/MyApp
sed -i '' 's/MyApp/HelloApp/g' Package.swift version.env

# 2. Copy scripts
cp assets/templates/package_app.sh Scripts/
cp assets/templates/compile_and_run.sh Scripts/
chmod +x Scripts/*.sh

# 3. Build and launch
swift build
Scripts/compile_and_run.sh
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/macos-spm-app-packaging`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Common Notarization Failures

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `The software asset has already been uploaded` | Duplicate submission for same version | Bump `BUILD_NUMBER` in `version.env` and repackage. |
| `Package Invalid: Invalid Code Signing Entitlements` | Entitlements in `.entitlements` file don't match provisioning | Audit entitlements against Apple's allowed set; remove unsupported keys. |
| `The executable does not have the hardened runtime enabled` | Missing `--options runtime` flag in `codesign` invocation | Edit `sign-and-notarize.sh` to add `--options runtime` to all `codesign` calls. |
| Notarization hangs / no status email | `xcrun notarytool` network or credential issue | Run `xcrun notarytool history` to check status; re-export App Store Connect API key if expired. |
| `stapler validate` fails after successful notarization | Ticket not yet propagated | Wait ~60 s, then re-run `xcrun stapler staple`. |

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Templates

- `assets/templates/package_app.sh`: Build binaries, create the .app bundle, copy resources, sign.
- `assets/templates/compile_and_run.sh`: Dev loop to kill running app, package, launch.
- `assets/templates/build_icon.sh`: Generate .icns from an Icon Composer file (requires Xcode install).
- `assets/templates/sign-and-notarize.sh`: Notarize, staple, and zip a release build.
- `assets/templates/make_appcast.sh`: Generate Sparkle appcast entries for updates.
- `assets/templates/setup_dev_signing.sh`: Create a stable dev code-signing identity.
- `assets/templates/launch.sh`: Simple launcher for a packaged .app.
- `assets/templates/version.env`: Example version file consumed by packaging scripts.
- `assets/templates/bootstrap/`: Minimal SwiftPM macOS app skeleton (Package.swift, Sources/, version.env).

#### Imported: Notes

- Keep entitlements and signing configuration explicit; edit the template scripts instead of reimplementing.
- Remove Sparkle steps if you do not use Sparkle for updates.
- Sparkle relies on the bundle build number (`CFBundleVersion`), so `BUILD_NUMBER` in `version.env` must increase for each update.
- For menu bar apps, set `MENU_BAR_APP=1` when packaging to emit `LSUIElement` in Info.plist.
