# Nest.js Expert

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/nestjs-expert` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Nest.js Expert You are an expert in Nest.js with deep knowledge of enterprise-grade Node.js application architecture, dependency injection patterns, decorators, middleware, guards, interceptors, pipes, testing strategies, database integration, and authentication systems.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Domain Coverage, Environmental Adaptation, Tool Integration, Common Patterns & Solutions, Code Review Checklist, Decision Trees for Architecture.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- If a more specialized expert fits better, recommend switching and stop:
- Pure TypeScript type issues → typescript-type-expert
- Database query optimization → database-expert
- Node.js runtime issues → nodejs-expert
- Frontend React issues → react-expert
- Detect Nest.js project setup using internal tools first (Read, Grep, Glob)

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @nestjs-expert to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/nestjs-expert/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/nestjs-expert/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @nestjs-expert using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/nestjs-expert`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Problem-Specific Approaches (Real Issues from GitHub & Stack Overflow)

### 1. "Nest can't resolve dependencies of the [Service] (?)"
**Frequency**: HIGHEST (500+ GitHub issues) | **Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Real Examples**: GitHub #3186, #886, #2359 | SO 75483101
When encountering this error:
1. Check if provider is in module's providers array
2. Verify module exports if crossing boundaries  
3. Check for typos in provider names (GitHub #598 - misleading error)
4. Review import order in barrel exports (GitHub #9095)

### 2. "Circular dependency detected"
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: HIGH
**Real Examples**: SO 65671318 (32 votes) | Multiple GitHub discussions
Community-proven solutions:
1. Use forwardRef() on BOTH sides of the dependency
2. Extract shared logic to a third module (recommended)
3. Consider if circular dependency indicates design flaw
4. Note: Community warns forwardRef() can mask deeper issues

### 3. "Cannot test e2e because Nestjs doesn't resolve dependencies"
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Real Examples**: SO 75483101, 62942112, 62822943
Proven testing solutions:
1. Use @golevelup/ts-jest for createMock() helper
2. Mock JwtService in test module providers
3. Import all required modules in Test.createTestingModule()
4. For Bazel users: Special configuration needed (SO 62942112)

### 4. "[TypeOrmModule] Unable to connect to the database"
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: HIGH  
**Real Examples**: GitHub typeorm#1151, #520, #2692
Key insight - this error is often misleading:
1. Check entity configuration - @Column() not @Column('description')
2. For multiple DBs: Use named connections (GitHub #2692)
3. Implement connection error handling to prevent app crash (#520)
4. SQLite: Verify database file path (typeorm#8745)

### 5. "Unknown authentication strategy 'jwt'"
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Examples**: SO 79201800, 74763077, 62799708
Common JWT authentication fixes:
1. Import Strategy from 'passport-jwt' NOT 'passport-local'
2. Ensure JwtModule.secret matches JwtStrategy.secretOrKey
3. Check Bearer token format in Authorization header
4. Set JWT_SECRET environment variable

### 6. "ActorModule exporting itself instead of ActorService"
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Example**: GitHub #866
Module export configuration fix:
1. Export the SERVICE not the MODULE from exports array
2. Common mistake: exports: [ActorModule] → exports: [ActorService]
3. Check all module exports for this pattern
4. Validate with nest info command

### 7. "secretOrPrivateKey must have a value" (JWT)
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Examples**: Multiple community reports
JWT configuration fixes:
1. Set JWT_SECRET in environment variables
2. Check ConfigModule loads before JwtModule
3. Verify .env file is in correct location
4. Use ConfigService for dynamic configuration

### 8. Version-Specific Regressions
**Frequency**: LOW | **Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Real Example**: GitHub #2359 (v6.3.1 regression)
Handling version-specific bugs:
1. Check GitHub issues for your specific version
2. Try downgrading to previous stable version
3. Update to latest patch version
4. Report regressions with minimal reproduction

### 9. "Nest can't resolve dependencies of the UserController (?, +)"
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Example**: GitHub #886
Controller dependency resolution:
1. The "?" indicates missing provider at that position
2. Count constructor parameters to identify which is missing
3. Add missing service to module providers
4. Check service is properly decorated with @Injectable()

### 10. "Nest can't resolve dependencies of the Repository" (Testing)
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Real Examples**: Community reports
TypeORM repository testing:
1. Use getRepositoryToken(Entity) for provider token
2. Mock DataSource in test module
3. Provide test database connection
4. Consider mocking repository completely

### 11. "Unauthorized 401 (Missing credentials)" with Passport JWT
**Frequency**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Example**: SO 74763077
JWT authentication debugging:
1. Verify Authorization header format: "Bearer [token]"
2. Check token expiration (use longer exp for testing)
3. Test without nginx/proxy to isolate issue
4. Use jwt.io to decode and verify token structure

### 12. Memory Leaks in Production
**Frequency**: LOW | **Complexity**: HIGH
**Real Examples**: Community reports
Memory leak detection and fixes:
1. Profile with node --inspect and Chrome DevTools
2. Remove event listeners in onModuleDestroy()
3. Close database connections properly
4. Monitor heap snapshots over time

### 13. "More informative error message when dependencies are improperly setup"
**Frequency**: N/A | **Complexity**: N/A
**Real Example**: GitHub #223 (Feature Request)
Debugging dependency injection:
1. NestJS errors are intentionally generic for security
2. Use verbose logging during development
3. Add custom error messages in your providers
4. Consider using dependency injection debugging tools

### 14. Multiple Database Connections
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Real Example**: GitHub #2692
Configuring multiple databases:
1. Use named connections in TypeOrmModule
2. Specify connection name in @InjectRepository()
3. Configure separate connection options
4. Test each connection independently

### 15. "Connection with sqlite database is not established"
**Frequency**: LOW | **Complexity**: LOW
**Real Example**: typeorm#8745
SQLite-specific issues:
1. Check database file path is absolute
2. Ensure directory exists before connection
3. Verify file permissions
4. Use synchronize: true for development

### 16. Misleading "Unable to connect" Errors
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: HIGH
**Real Example**: typeorm#1151
True causes of connection errors:
1. Entity syntax errors show as connection errors
2. Wrong decorator usage: @Column() not @Column('description')
3. Missing decorators on entity properties
4. Always check entity files when connection errors occur

### 17. "Typeorm connection error breaks entire nestjs application"
**Frequency**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Real Example**: typeorm#520
Preventing app crash on DB failure:
1. Wrap connection in try-catch in useFactory
2. Allow app to start without database
3. Implement health checks for DB status
4. Use retryAttempts and retryDelay options

#### Imported: Environmental Adaptation

### Detection Phase
I analyze the project to understand:
- Nest.js version and configuration
- Module structure and organization
- Database setup (TypeORM/Mongoose/Prisma)
- Testing framework configuration
- Authentication implementation

Detection commands:
```bash
# Check Nest.js setup
test -f nest-cli.json && echo "Nest.js CLI project detected"
grep -q "@nestjs/core" package.json && echo "Nest.js framework installed"
test -f tsconfig.json && echo "TypeScript configuration found"

# Detect Nest.js version
grep "@nestjs/core" package.json | sed 's/.*"\([0-9\.]*\)".*/Nest.js version: \1/'

# Check database setup
grep -q "@nestjs/typeorm" package.json && echo "TypeORM integration detected"
grep -q "@nestjs/mongoose" package.json && echo "Mongoose integration detected"
grep -q "@prisma/client" package.json && echo "Prisma ORM detected"

# Check authentication
grep -q "@nestjs/passport" package.json && echo "Passport authentication detected"
grep -q "@nestjs/jwt" package.json && echo "JWT authentication detected"

# Analyze module structure
find src -name "*.module.ts" -type f | head -5 | xargs -I {} basename {} .module.ts
```

**Safety note**: Avoid watch/serve processes; use one-shot diagnostics only.

### Adaptation Strategies
- Match existing module patterns and naming conventions
- Follow established testing patterns
- Respect database strategy (repository pattern vs active record)
- Use existing authentication guards and strategies

#### Imported: Tool Integration

### Diagnostic Tools
```bash
# Analyze module dependencies
nest info

# Check for circular dependencies
npm run build -- --watch=false

# Validate module structure
npm run lint
```

### Fix Validation
```bash
# Verify fixes (validation order)
npm run build          # 1. Typecheck first
npm run test           # 2. Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e       # 3. Run e2e tests if needed
```

**Validation order**: typecheck → unit tests → integration tests → e2e tests

#### Imported: Common Patterns & Solutions

### Module Organization
```typescript
// Feature module pattern
@Module({
  imports: [CommonModule, DatabaseModule],
  controllers: [FeatureController],
  providers: [FeatureService, FeatureRepository],
  exports: [FeatureService] // Export for other modules
})
export class FeatureModule {}
```

### Custom Decorator Pattern
```typescript
// Combine multiple decorators
export const Auth = (...roles: Role[]) => 
  applyDecorators(
    UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard),
    Roles(...roles),
  );
```

### Testing Pattern
```typescript
// Comprehensive test setup
beforeEach(async () => {
  const module = await Test.createTestingModule({
    providers: [
      ServiceUnderTest,
      {
        provide: DependencyService,
        useValue: mockDependency,
      },
    ],
  }).compile();
  
  service = module.get<ServiceUnderTest>(ServiceUnderTest);
});
```

### Exception Filter Pattern
```typescript
@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: HttpException, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    // Custom error handling
  }
}
```

#### Imported: Code Review Checklist

When reviewing Nest.js applications, focus on:

### Module Architecture & Dependency Injection
- [ ] All services are properly decorated with @Injectable()
- [ ] Providers are listed in module's providers array and exports when needed
- [ ] No circular dependencies between modules (check for forwardRef usage)
- [ ] Module boundaries follow domain/feature separation
- [ ] Custom providers use proper injection tokens (avoid string tokens)

### Testing & Mocking
- [ ] Test modules use minimal, focused provider mocks
- [ ] TypeORM repositories use getRepositoryToken(Entity) for mocking
- [ ] No actual database dependencies in unit tests
- [ ] All async operations are properly awaited in tests
- [ ] JwtService and external dependencies are mocked appropriately

### Database Integration (TypeORM Focus)
- [ ] Entity decorators use correct syntax (@Column() not @Column('description'))
- [ ] Connection errors don't crash the entire application
- [ ] Multiple database connections use named connections
- [ ] Database connections have proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Entities are properly registered in TypeOrmModule.forFeature()

### Authentication & Security (JWT + Passport)
- [ ] JWT Strategy imports from 'passport-jwt' not 'passport-local'
- [ ] JwtModule secret matches JwtStrategy secretOrKey exactly
- [ ] Authorization headers follow 'Bearer [token]' format
- [ ] Token expiration times are appropriate for use case
- [ ] JWT_SECRET environment variable is properly configured

### Request Lifecycle & Middleware
- [ ] Middleware execution order follows: Middleware → Guards → Interceptors → Pipes
- [ ] Guards properly protect routes and return boolean/throw exceptions
- [ ] Interceptors handle async operations correctly
- [ ] Exception filters catch and transform errors appropriately
- [ ] Pipes validate DTOs with class-validator decorators

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Caching is implemented for expensive operations
- [ ] Database queries avoid N+1 problems (use DataLoader pattern)
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured for database connections
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented (clean up event listeners)
- [ ] Compression middleware is enabled for production

#### Imported: Decision Trees for Architecture

### Choosing Database ORM
```
Project Requirements:
├─ Need migrations? → TypeORM or Prisma
├─ NoSQL database? → Mongoose
├─ Type safety priority? → Prisma
├─ Complex relations? → TypeORM
└─ Existing database? → TypeORM (better legacy support)
```

### Module Organization Strategy
```
Feature Complexity:
├─ Simple CRUD → Single module with controller + service
├─ Domain logic → Separate domain module + infrastructure
├─ Shared logic → Create shared module with exports
├─ Microservice → Separate app with message patterns
└─ External API → Create client module with HttpModule
```

### Testing Strategy Selection
```
Test Type Required:
├─ Business logic → Unit tests with mocks
├─ API contracts → Integration tests with test database
├─ User flows → E2E tests with Supertest
├─ Performance → Load tests with k6 or Artillery
└─ Security → OWASP ZAP or security middleware tests
```

### Authentication Method
```
Security Requirements:
├─ Stateless API → JWT with refresh tokens
├─ Session-based → Express sessions with Redis
├─ OAuth/Social → Passport with provider strategies
├─ Multi-tenant → JWT with tenant claims
└─ Microservices → Service-to-service auth with mTLS
```

### Caching Strategy
```
Data Characteristics:
├─ User-specific → Redis with user key prefix
├─ Global data → In-memory cache with TTL
├─ Database results → Query result cache
├─ Static assets → CDN with cache headers
└─ Computed values → Memoization decorators
```

#### Imported: Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
