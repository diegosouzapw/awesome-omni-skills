# SwiftUI UI Patterns

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/swiftui-ui-patterns` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# SwiftUI UI Patterns

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: State ownership summary, Anti-patterns, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- When creating or refactoring SwiftUI screens, flows, or reusable UI components.
- When you need guidance on navigation, sheets, async state, previews, or component patterns.
- Identify the feature or screen and the primary interaction model (list, detail, editor, settings, tabbed).
- Find a nearby example in the repo with rg "TabView\(" or similar, then read the closest SwiftUI view.
- Apply local conventions: prefer SwiftUI-native state, keep state local when possible, and use environment injection for shared dependencies.
- Choose the relevant component reference from references/components-index.md and follow its guidance.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `references/app-wiring.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `references/async-state.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Define the view's state, ownership location, and minimum OS assumptions before writing UI code.
2. Identify which dependencies belong in @Environment and which should stay as explicit initializer inputs.
3. Sketch the view hierarchy, routing model, and presentation points; extract repeated parts into subviews. For complex navigation, read references/navigationstack.md, references/sheets.md, or references/deeplinks.md. Build and verify no compiler errors before proceeding.
4. Implement async loading with .task or .task(id:), plus explicit loading and error states when needed. Read references/async-state.md when the work depends on changing inputs or cancellation.
5. Add previews for the primary and secondary states, then add accessibility labels or identifiers when the UI is interactive. Read references/previews.md when the view needs fixtures or injected mock dependencies.
6. Validate with a build: confirm no compiler errors, check that previews render without crashing, ensure state changes propagate correctly, and sanity-check that list identity and observation scope will not cause avoidable re-renders. Read references/performance.md if the screen is large, scroll-heavy, or frequently updated. For common SwiftUI compilation errors — missing @State annotations, ambiguous ViewBuilder closures, or mismatched generic types — resolve them before updating callsites. If the build fails: read the error message carefully, fix the identified issue, then rebuild before proceeding to the next step. If a preview crashes, isolate the offending subview, confirm its state initialisation is valid, and re-run the preview before continuing.
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow for a new SwiftUI view

1. Define the view's state, ownership location, and minimum OS assumptions before writing UI code.
2. Identify which dependencies belong in `@Environment` and which should stay as explicit initializer inputs.
3. Sketch the view hierarchy, routing model, and presentation points; extract repeated parts into subviews. For complex navigation, read `references/navigationstack.md`, `references/sheets.md`, or `references/deeplinks.md`. **Build and verify no compiler errors before proceeding.**
4. Implement async loading with `.task` or `.task(id:)`, plus explicit loading and error states when needed. Read `references/async-state.md` when the work depends on changing inputs or cancellation.
5. Add previews for the primary and secondary states, then add accessibility labels or identifiers when the UI is interactive. Read `references/previews.md` when the view needs fixtures or injected mock dependencies.
6. Validate with a build: confirm no compiler errors, check that previews render without crashing, ensure state changes propagate correctly, and sanity-check that list identity and observation scope will not cause avoidable re-renders. Read `references/performance.md` if the screen is large, scroll-heavy, or frequently updated. For common SwiftUI compilation errors — missing `@State` annotations, ambiguous `ViewBuilder` closures, or mismatched generic types — resolve them before updating callsites. **If the build fails:** read the error message carefully, fix the identified issue, then rebuild before proceeding to the next step. If a preview crashes, isolate the offending subview, confirm its state initialisation is valid, and re-run the preview before continuing.

#### Imported: State ownership summary

Use the narrowest state tool that matches the ownership model:

| Scenario | Preferred pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Local UI state owned by one view | `@State` |
| Child mutates parent-owned value state | `@Binding` |
| Root-owned reference model on iOS 17+ | `@State` with an `@Observable` type |
| Child reads or mutates an injected `@Observable` model on iOS 17+ | Pass it explicitly as a stored property |
| Shared app service or configuration | `@Environment(Type.self)` |
| Legacy reference model on iOS 16 and earlier | `@StateObject` at the root, `@ObservedObject` when injected |

Choose the ownership location first, then pick the wrapper. Do not introduce a reference model when plain value state is enough.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @swiftui-ui-patterns to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @swiftui-ui-patterns against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @swiftui-ui-patterns for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @swiftui-ui-patterns using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick start

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Use modern SwiftUI state (@State, @Binding, @Observable, @Environment) and avoid unnecessary view models.
- If the deployment target includes iOS 16 or earlier and cannot use the Observation API introduced in iOS 17, fall back to ObservableObject with @StateObject for root ownership, @ObservedObject for injected observation, and @EnvironmentObject only for truly shared app-level state.
- Prefer composition; keep views small and focused.
- Use async/await with .task and explicit loading/error states. For restart, cancellation, and debouncing guidance, read references/async-state.md.
- Keep shared app services in @Environment, but prefer explicit initializer injection for feature-local dependencies and models. For root wiring patterns, read references/app-wiring.md.
- Prefer the newest SwiftUI API that fits the deployment target and call out the minimum OS whenever a pattern depends on it.
- Maintain existing legacy patterns only when editing legacy files.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: General rules to follow

- Use modern SwiftUI state (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@Observable`, `@Environment`) and avoid unnecessary view models.
- If the deployment target includes iOS 16 or earlier and cannot use the Observation API introduced in iOS 17, fall back to `ObservableObject` with `@StateObject` for root ownership, `@ObservedObject` for injected observation, and `@EnvironmentObject` only for truly shared app-level state.
- Prefer composition; keep views small and focused.
- Use async/await with `.task` and explicit loading/error states. For restart, cancellation, and debouncing guidance, read `references/async-state.md`.
- Keep shared app services in `@Environment`, but prefer explicit initializer injection for feature-local dependencies and models. For root wiring patterns, read `references/app-wiring.md`.
- Prefer the newest SwiftUI API that fits the deployment target and call out the minimum OS whenever a pattern depends on it.
- Maintain existing legacy patterns only when editing legacy files.
- Follow the project's formatter and style guide.
- **Sheets**: Prefer `.sheet(item:)` over `.sheet(isPresented:)` when state represents a selected model. Avoid `if let` inside a sheet body. Sheets should own their actions and call `dismiss()` internally instead of forwarding `onCancel`/`onConfirm` closures.
- **Scroll-driven reveals**: Prefer deriving a normalized progress value from scroll offset and driving the visual state from that single source of truth. Avoid parallel gesture state machines unless scroll alone cannot express the interaction.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/swiftui-ui-patterns`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Cross-cutting references

- `references/navigationstack.md`: navigation ownership, per-tab history, and enum routing.
- `references/sheets.md`: centralized modal presentation and enum-driven sheets.
- `references/deeplinks.md`: URL handling and routing external links into app destinations.
- `references/app-wiring.md`: root dependency graph, environment usage, and app shell wiring.
- `references/async-state.md`: `.task`, `.task(id:)`, cancellation, debouncing, and async UI state.
- `references/previews.md`: `#Preview`, fixtures, mock environments, and isolated preview setup.
- `references/performance.md`: stable identity, observation scope, lazy containers, and render-cost guardrails.

#### Imported: Component references

Use `references/components-index.md` as the entry point. Each component reference should include:
- Intent and best-fit scenarios.
- Minimal usage pattern with local conventions.
- Pitfalls and performance notes.
- Paths to existing examples in the current repo.

#### Imported: Adding a new component reference

- Create `references/<component>.md`.
- Keep it short and actionable; link to concrete files in the current repo.
- Update `references/components-index.md` with the new entry.

#### Imported: Anti-patterns

- Giant views that mix layout, business logic, networking, routing, and formatting in one file.
- Multiple boolean flags for mutually exclusive sheets, alerts, or navigation destinations.
- Live service calls directly inside `body`-driven code paths instead of view lifecycle hooks or injected models/services.
- Reaching for `AnyView` to work around type mismatches that should be solved with better composition.
- Defaulting every shared dependency to `@EnvironmentObject` or a global router without a clear ownership reason.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
