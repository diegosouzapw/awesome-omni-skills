# Three.js Skills

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/threejs-skills` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Three.js Skills Systematically create high-quality 3D scenes and interactive experiences using Three.js best practices.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Common Patterns, Advanced Techniques, Modern Three.js Practices (r183), Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Requests 3D visualizations or graphics ("create a 3D model", "show in 3D")
- Wants interactive 3D experiences ("rotating cube", "explorable scene")
- Needs WebGL or canvas-based rendering
- Asks for animations, particles, or visual effects
- Mentions Three.js, WebGL, or 3D rendering
- Wants to visualize data in 3D space

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. What objects need to be rendered
2. Camera position and field of view
3. Lighting setup required
4. Interaction model (static, rotating, user-controlled)
5. BoxGeometry - cubes, rectangular prisms
6. SphereGeometry - spheres, planets
7. CylinderGeometry - cylinders, tubes

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Setup Pattern

### 1. Essential Three.js Imports

Use ES module import maps for modern Three.js (r183+):

```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.183.0/build/three.module.js",
    "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.183.0/examples/jsm/"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";
</script>
```

For production with npm/vite/webpack:

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";
```

### 2. Scene Initialization

Every Three.js artifact needs these core components:

```javascript
// Scene - contains all 3D objects
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Camera - defines viewing perspective
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75, // Field of view
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, // Aspect ratio
  0.1, // Near clipping plane
  1000, // Far clipping plane
);
camera.position.z = 5;

// Renderer - draws the scene
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
```

### 3. Animation Loop

Use `renderer.setAnimationLoop()` (preferred) or `requestAnimationFrame`:

```javascript
// Preferred: setAnimationLoop (handles WebXR compatibility)
renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => {
  mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});

// Alternative: manual requestAnimationFrame
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

#### Imported: Systematic Development Process

### 1. Define the Scene

Start by identifying:

- **What objects** need to be rendered
- **Camera position** and field of view
- **Lighting setup** required
- **Interaction model** (static, rotating, user-controlled)

### 2. Build Geometry

Choose appropriate geometry types:

**Basic Shapes:**

- `BoxGeometry` - cubes, rectangular prisms
- `SphereGeometry` - spheres, planets
- `CylinderGeometry` - cylinders, tubes
- `PlaneGeometry` - flat surfaces, ground planes
- `TorusGeometry` - donuts, rings

**CapsuleGeometry** is available (stable since r142):

```javascript
new THREE.CapsuleGeometry(0.5, 1, 4, 8); // radius, length, capSegments, radialSegments
```

### 3. Apply Materials

Choose materials based on visual needs:

**Common Materials:**

- `MeshBasicMaterial` - unlit, flat colors (no lighting needed)
- `MeshStandardMaterial` - physically-based, realistic (needs lighting)
- `MeshPhongMaterial` - shiny surfaces with specular highlights
- `MeshLambertMaterial` - matte surfaces, diffuse reflection

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0x00ff00,
  metalness: 0.5,
  roughness: 0.5,
});
```

### 4. Add Lighting

**If using lit materials** (Standard, Phong, Lambert), add lights:

```javascript
// Ambient light - general illumination
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
scene.add(ambientLight);

// Directional light - like sunlight
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8);
directionalLight.position.set(5, 5, 5);
scene.add(directionalLight);
```

**Skip lighting** if using `MeshBasicMaterial` - it's unlit by design.

### 5. Handle Responsiveness

Always add window resize handling:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
});
```

#### Imported: Example Workflow

User: "Create an interactive 3D sphere that responds to mouse movement"

1. **Setup**: Import Three.js, create scene/camera/renderer
2. **Geometry**: Create `SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32)` for smooth sphere
3. **Material**: Use `MeshStandardMaterial` for realistic look
4. **Lighting**: Add ambient + directional lights
5. **Interaction**: Track mouse position, update camera
6. **Animation**: Rotate sphere, render continuously
7. **Responsive**: Add window resize handler
8. **Result**: Smooth, interactive 3D sphere ✓

#### Imported: Summary

Three.js artifacts require systematic setup:

1. Import Three.js via import maps or build tools
2. Initialize scene, camera, renderer
3. Create geometry + material = mesh
4. Add lighting if using lit materials
5. Implement animation loop (prefer `setAnimationLoop`)
6. Handle window resize
7. Set `renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace`

Follow these patterns for reliable, performant 3D experiences.

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### Rotating Object

```javascript
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### OrbitControls

With import maps or build tools, OrbitControls works directly:

```javascript
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";

const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
controls.enableDamping = true;

// Update in animation loop
renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => {
  controls.update();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
```

### Custom Camera Controls (Alternative)

For lightweight custom controls without importing OrbitControls:

```javascript
let isDragging = false;
let previousMousePosition = { x: 0, y: 0 };

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mousedown", () => {
  isDragging = true;
});

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mouseup", () => {
  isDragging = false;
});

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    const deltaX = event.clientX - previousMousePosition.x;
    const deltaY = event.clientY - previousMousePosition.y;

    // Rotate camera around scene
    const rotationSpeed = 0.005;
    camera.position.x += deltaX * rotationSpeed;
    camera.position.y -= deltaY * rotationSpeed;
    camera.lookAt(scene.position);
  }

  previousMousePosition = { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY };
});

// Zoom with mouse wheel
renderer.domElement.addEventListener("wheel", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  camera.position.z += event.deltaY * 0.01;
  camera.position.z = Math.max(2, Math.min(20, camera.position.z)); // Clamp
});
```

### Raycasting for Object Selection

Detect mouse clicks and hovers on 3D objects:

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
const clickableObjects = []; // Array of meshes that can be clicked

// Update mouse position
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
});

// Detect clicks
window.addEventListener("click", () => {
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(clickableObjects);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const clickedObject = intersects[0].object;
    // Handle click - change color, scale, etc.
    clickedObject.material.color.set(0xff0000);
  }
});

// Hover effect in animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(clickableObjects);

  // Reset all objects
  clickableObjects.forEach((obj) => {
    obj.scale.set(1, 1, 1);
  });

  // Highlight hovered object
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    intersects[0].object.scale.set(1.2, 1.2, 1.2);
    document.body.style.cursor = "pointer";
  } else {
    document.body.style.cursor = "default";
  }

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### Particle System

```javascript
const particlesGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
const particlesCount = 1000;
const posArray = new Float32Array(particlesCount * 3);

for (let i = 0; i < particlesCount * 3; i++) {
  posArray[i] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
}

particlesGeometry.setAttribute(
  "position",
  new THREE.BufferAttribute(posArray, 3),
);

const particlesMaterial = new THREE.PointsMaterial({
  size: 0.02,
  color: 0xffffff,
});

const particlesMesh = new THREE.Points(particlesGeometry, particlesMaterial);
scene.add(particlesMesh);
```

### User Interaction (Mouse Movement)

```javascript
let mouseX = 0;
let mouseY = 0;

document.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
  mouseX = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouseY = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
});

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  camera.position.x = mouseX * 2;
  camera.position.y = mouseY * 2;
  camera.lookAt(scene.position);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### Loading Textures

```javascript
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load("texture-url.jpg");

const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  map: texture,
});
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @threejs-skills-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @threejs-skills-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @threejs-skills-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @threejs-skills-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Reuse geometries and materials when creating multiple similar objects
- Use BufferGeometry for custom shapes (more efficient)
- Limit particle counts to maintain 60fps (start with 1000-5000)
- Dispose of resources when removing objects:
- Always set antialias: true on renderer for smooth edges
- Use appropriate camera FOV (45-75 degrees typical)
- Position lights thoughtfully - avoid overlapping multiple bright lights

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Performance

- **Reuse geometries and materials** when creating multiple similar objects
- **Use `BufferGeometry`** for custom shapes (more efficient)
- **Limit particle counts** to maintain 60fps (start with 1000-5000)
- **Dispose of resources** when removing objects:
  ```javascript
  geometry.dispose();
  material.dispose();
  texture.dispose();
  ```

### Visual Quality

- Always set `antialias: true` on renderer for smooth edges
- Use appropriate camera FOV (45-75 degrees typical)
- Position lights thoughtfully - avoid overlapping multiple bright lights
- Add ambient + directional lighting for realistic scenes

### Code Organization

- Initialize scene, camera, renderer at the top
- Group related objects (e.g., all particles in one group)
- Keep animation logic in the animate function
- Separate object creation into functions for complex scenes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using `outputEncoding` instead of `outputColorSpace` (renamed in r152)
- ❌ Forgetting to add objects to scene with `scene.add()`
- ❌ Using lit materials without adding lights
- ❌ Not handling window resize
- ❌ Forgetting to call `renderer.render()` in animation loop
- ❌ Using `THREE.Clock` without considering `THREE.Timer` (recommended in r183)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/threejs-skills`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

**Black screen / Nothing renders:**

- Check if objects added to scene
- Verify camera position isn't inside objects
- Ensure renderer.render() is called
- Add lights if using lit materials

**Poor performance:**

- Reduce particle count
- Lower geometry detail (segments)
- Reuse materials/geometries
- Check browser console for errors

**Objects not visible:**

- Check object position vs camera position
- Verify material has visible color/properties
- Ensure camera far plane includes objects
- Add lighting if needed

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Advanced Techniques

### Visual Polish for Portfolio-Grade Rendering

**Shadows:**

```javascript
// Enable shadows on renderer
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap; // Soft shadows

// Light that casts shadows
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
directionalLight.position.set(5, 10, 5);
directionalLight.castShadow = true;

// Configure shadow quality
directionalLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;
directionalLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;
directionalLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
directionalLight.shadow.camera.far = 50;

scene.add(directionalLight);

// Objects cast and receive shadows
mesh.castShadow = true;
mesh.receiveShadow = true;

// Ground plane receives shadows
const groundGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(20, 20);
const groundMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x808080 });
const ground = new THREE.Mesh(groundGeometry, groundMaterial);
ground.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
ground.receiveShadow = true;
scene.add(ground);
```

**Environment Maps & Reflections:**

```javascript
// Create environment map from cubemap
const loader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader();
const envMap = loader.load([
  "px.jpg",
  "nx.jpg", // positive x, negative x
  "py.jpg",
  "ny.jpg", // positive y, negative y
  "pz.jpg",
  "nz.jpg", // positive z, negative z
]);

scene.environment = envMap; // Affects all PBR materials
scene.background = envMap; // Optional: use as skybox

// Or apply to specific materials
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  metalness: 1.0,
  roughness: 0.1,
  envMap: envMap,
});
```

**Tone Mapping & Output Encoding:**

```javascript
// Improve color accuracy and HDR rendering
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;
renderer.toneMappingExposure = 1.0;
renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace; // Was outputEncoding in older versions

// Makes colors more vibrant and realistic
```

**Fog for Depth:**

```javascript
// Linear fog
scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(0xcccccc, 10, 50); // color, near, far

// Or exponential fog (more realistic)
scene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0xcccccc, 0.02); // color, density
```

### Custom Geometry from Vertices

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
const vertices = new Float32Array([-1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 0]);
geometry.setAttribute("position", new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices, 3));
```

### Post-Processing Effects

Post-processing effects are available via import maps or build tools. See `threejs-postprocessing` skill for EffectComposer, bloom, DOF, and more.

### Group Objects

```javascript
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.add(mesh1);
group.add(mesh2);
group.rotation.y = Math.PI / 4;
scene.add(group);
```

#### Imported: Modern Three.js Practices (r183)

### Modular Imports

```javascript
// With npm/vite/webpack:
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
import { EffectComposer } from "three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js";
```

### WebGPU Renderer (Alternative)

Three.js r183 includes a WebGPU renderer as an alternative to WebGL:

```javascript
import { WebGPURenderer } from "three/addons/renderers/webgpu/WebGPURenderer.js";

const renderer = new WebGPURenderer({ antialias: true });
await renderer.init();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
```

WebGPU uses TSL (Three.js Shading Language) instead of GLSL for custom shaders. See `threejs-shaders` for details.

### Timer (r183 Recommended)

`THREE.Timer` is recommended over `THREE.Clock` as of r183:

```javascript
const timer = new THREE.Timer();

renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => {
  timer.update();
  const delta = timer.getDelta();
  const elapsed = timer.getElapsed();

  mesh.rotation.y += delta;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
```

**Benefits over Clock:**

- Not affected by page visibility (pauses when tab is hidden)
- Cleaner API design
- Better integration with `setAnimationLoop`

### Animation Libraries (GSAP Integration)

```javascript
// Smooth timeline-based animations
import gsap from "gsap";

// Instead of manual animation loops:
gsap.to(mesh.position, {
  x: 5,
  duration: 2,
  ease: "power2.inOut",
});

// Complex sequences:
const timeline = gsap.timeline();
timeline
  .to(mesh.rotation, { y: Math.PI * 2, duration: 2 })
  .to(mesh.scale, { x: 2, y: 2, z: 2, duration: 1 }, "-=1");
```

**Why GSAP:**

- Professional easing functions
- Timeline control (pause, reverse, scrub)
- Better than manual lerping for complex animations

### Scroll-Based Interactions

```javascript
// Sync 3D animations with page scroll
let scrollY = window.scrollY;

window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
  scrollY = window.scrollY;
});

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  // Rotate based on scroll position
  mesh.rotation.y = scrollY * 0.001;

  // Move camera through scene
  camera.position.y = -(scrollY / window.innerHeight) * 10;

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

**Advanced scroll libraries:**

- ScrollTrigger (GSAP plugin)
- Locomotive Scroll
- Lenis smooth scroll

### Performance Optimization in Production

```javascript
// Level of Detail (LOD)
const lod = new THREE.LOD();
lod.addLevel(highDetailMesh, 0); // Close up
lod.addLevel(mediumDetailMesh, 10); // Medium distance
lod.addLevel(lowDetailMesh, 50); // Far away
scene.add(lod);

// Instanced meshes for many identical objects
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();
const instancedMesh = new THREE.InstancedMesh(geometry, material, 1000);

// Set transforms for each instance
const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4();
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  matrix.setPosition(
    Math.random() * 100,
    Math.random() * 100,
    Math.random() * 100,
  );
  instancedMesh.setMatrixAt(i, matrix);
}
```

### Modern Loading Patterns

```javascript
// In production, load 3D models:
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader";

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load("model.gltf", (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);

  // Traverse and setup materials
  gltf.scene.traverse((child) => {
    if (child.isMesh) {
      child.castShadow = true;
      child.receiveShadow = true;
    }
  });
});
```

### When to Use What

**Import Map Approach:**

- Quick prototypes and demos
- Educational content
- Artifacts and embedded experiences
- No build step required

**Production Build Approach:**

- Client projects and portfolios
- Complex applications
- Performance-critical applications
- Team collaboration with version control
