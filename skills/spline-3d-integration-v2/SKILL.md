# Spline 3D Integration Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/spline-3d-integration` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Spline 3D Integration Skill Master guide for embedding interactive 3D scenes from Spline.design into web projects. ---

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: What Is Spline?, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to embed an interactive Spline scene into a web project.
- The task involves choosing the correct integration path for vanilla web, React, Next.js, Vue, or iframe contexts.
- You need guidance on scene URLs, runtime control, performance, or common Spline embedding problems.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: adding interactive 3D scenes from Spline.design to web projects, including React embedding and runtime control API.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Stack - Method
2. Vanilla HTML/JS - <spline-viewer> web component OR @splinetool/runtime
3. React / Vite - @splinetool/react-spline
4. Next.js - @splinetool/react-spline/next
5. Vue - @splinetool/vue-spline
6. iframe (Webflow, Notion, etc.) - Public URL iframe
7. ✅ Toggle Hide Background ON if the site has a dark or custom background

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: STEP 1 — Identify the Stack

Before writing any code, check the existing project files to determine the framework.

| Stack                          | Method                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vanilla HTML/JS                | `<spline-viewer>` web component OR `@splinetool/runtime` |
| React / Vite                   | `@splinetool/react-spline`                               |
| Next.js                        | `@splinetool/react-spline/next`                          |
| Vue                            | `@splinetool/vue-spline`                                 |
| iframe (Webflow, Notion, etc.) | Public URL iframe                                        |

#### Imported: STEP 2 — Get the Scene URL

The user must go to their Spline editor → **Export** → **Code Export** → copy the `prod.spline.design` URL:

```
https://prod.spline.design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/scene.splinecode
```

**Before copying the URL, tell the user to check Play Settings:**

- ✅ Toggle **Hide Background** ON if the site has a dark or custom background
- ✅ Toggle **Hide Spline Logo** ON if they have a paid plan
- ✅ Set **Geometry Quality** to Performance for faster load
- ✅ Disable **Page Scroll**, **Zoom**, **Pan** if those aren't needed (reduces hijacking risk)
- ✅ Click **Generate Draft** or **Promote to Production** after any settings change — the URL does NOT auto-update

---

#### Imported: STEP 3 — Read the Relevant Guide

Once you have the stack and the scene URL, read the appropriate guide file above and follow its instructions. Always read COMMON_PROBLEMS.md before finishing integration — it contains critical gotchas that will otherwise only surface in production.

#### Imported: What Is Spline?

Spline is a browser-based 3D design tool — think Figma, but for 3D. Designers create interactive 3D scenes (objects, materials, animations, physics, events) in the Spline editor, then export them for the web via a hosted `.splinecode` file URL.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @spline-3d-integration-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/spline-3d-integration-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/spline-3d-integration-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @spline-3d-integration-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ABSOLUTE MANDATE: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build in common, generic, or safe styles. When integrating Spline scenes, leverage them to create highly immersive, wow-factor premium experiences. Combine them thoughtfully with typography and layout.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/spline-3d-integration`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
