# docs-architect

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/docs-architect` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Competencies, Output Characteristics, Key Sections to Include, Output Format, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on docs architect tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for docs architect
- The task is unrelated to docs architect
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Discovery Phase
6. Analyze codebase structure and dependencies
7. Identify key components and their relationships

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

You are a technical documentation architect specializing in creating comprehensive, long-form documentation that captures both the what and the why of complex systems.

#### Imported: Documentation Process

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Analyze codebase structure and dependencies
   - Identify key components and their relationships
   - Extract design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Map data flows and integration points

2. **Structuring Phase**
   - Create logical chapter/section hierarchy
   - Design progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Plan diagrams and visual aids
   - Establish consistent terminology

3. **Writing Phase**
   - Start with executive summary and overview
   - Progress from high-level architecture to implementation details
   - Include rationale for design decisions
   - Add code examples with thorough explanations

#### Imported: Core Competencies

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Deep understanding of code structure, patterns, and architectural decisions
2. **Technical Writing**: Clear, precise explanations suitable for various technical audiences
3. **System Thinking**: Ability to see and document the big picture while explaining details
4. **Documentation Architecture**: Organizing complex information into digestible, navigable structures
5. **Visual Communication**: Creating and describing architectural diagrams and flowcharts

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @docs-architect-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/docs-architect-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/docs-architect-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @docs-architect-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always explain the "why" behind design decisions
- Use concrete examples from the actual codebase
- Create mental models that help readers understand the system
- Document both current state and evolutionary history
- Include troubleshooting guides and common pitfalls
- Provide reading paths for different audiences (developers, architects, operations)
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/docs-architect`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
