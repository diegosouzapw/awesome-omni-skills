# Phase-Gated Debugging

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/phase-gated-debugging` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Phase-Gated Debugging

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: The Protocol, Bug-Type Strategies, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- a bug keeps getting "fixed" without resolving the underlying issue
- you need to slow an agent down and force disciplined debugging before code edits
- the failure is intermittent, a regression, performance-related, or otherwise hard to isolate
- you want an explicit user confirmation checkpoint before any fix is applied
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: debugging any bug. Enforces a 5-phase protocol where code edits are blocked until root cause is confirmed. Prevents premature fix attempts.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

AI coding agents see an error and immediately edit code. They guess at fixes, get it wrong, and spiral. This skill enforces a strict 5-phase protocol where you CANNOT edit source code until the root cause is identified and confirmed.

Based on [claude-debug](https://github.com/krabat-l/claude-debug) (full plugin with PreToolUse hook enforcement).

#### Imported: The Protocol

### Phase 1: REPRODUCE
Run the failing command/test. Capture the exact error. Run 2-3 times for consistency.
- Do NOT read source code
- Do NOT hypothesize
- Do NOT edit any files

### Phase 2: ISOLATE
Read code. Add diagnostic logging marked `// DEBUG`. Re-run with diagnostics. Binary search to narrow down.
- Only `// DEBUG` marked logging is allowed
- Do NOT fix the bug even if you see it

### Phase 3: ROOT CAUSE
Analyze WHY at the isolated location. Use "5 Whys" technique. Remove debug logging.

State: "This is my root cause analysis: [explanation]. Do you agree, or should I investigate further?"

**WAIT for user confirmation. Do NOT proceed without it.**

### Phase 4: FIX
Remove all `// DEBUG` lines. Apply minimal change addressing confirmed root cause.
- Only edit files related to root cause
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code

### Phase 5: VERIFY
Run original failing test — must pass. Run related tests. For intermittent bugs, run 5+ times.
If verification fails: root cause was wrong, go back to Phase 2.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @phase-gated-debugging to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @phase-gated-debugging against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @phase-gated-debugging for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @phase-gated-debugging using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- NEVER edit source code in phases 1-3 (except // DEBUG in phase 2)
- NEVER proceed past phase 3 without user confirmation
- ALWAYS reproduce before investigating
- ALWAYS verify after fixing
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Key Rules

1. NEVER edit source code in phases 1-3 (except `// DEBUG` in phase 2)
2. NEVER proceed past phase 3 without user confirmation
3. ALWAYS reproduce before investigating
4. ALWAYS verify after fixing

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/phase-gated-debugging`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Bug-Type Strategies

| Type | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Crash/Panic | Stack trace backward — trace the bad value to its source |
| Wrong Output | Binary search — log midpoint, halve search space each iteration |
| Intermittent | Compare passing vs failing run logs — find ordering divergence |
| Regression | `git bisect` — find the offending commit |
| Performance | Timing at stage boundaries — find the bottleneck |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
