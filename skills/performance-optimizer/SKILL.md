# Performance Optimizer

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/performance-optimizer` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Performance Optimizer Find and fix performance bottlenecks. Measure, optimize, verify. Make it fast.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Common Optimizations, Measuring Impact, Performance Budgets, Tools, Quick Wins, Optimization Checklist.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- App is slow or laggy
- User complains about performance
- Page load times are high
- API responses are slow
- Database queries take too long
- User mentions "slow", "lag", "performance", or "optimize"

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Page load time
2. API response time
3. Database query time
4. Function execution time
5. Memory usage
6. Network requests
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: The Optimization Process

### 1. Measure First

Never optimize without measuring:

```javascript
// Measure execution time
console.time('operation');
await slowOperation();
console.timeEnd('operation'); // operation: 2341ms
```

**What to measure:**
- Page load time
- API response time
- Database query time
- Function execution time
- Memory usage
- Network requests

### 2. Find the Bottleneck

Use profiling tools to find the slow parts:

**Browser:**
```
DevTools → Performance tab → Record → Stop
Look for long tasks (red bars)
```

**Node.js:**
```bash
node --prof app.js
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > profile.txt
```

**Database:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### 3. Optimize

Fix the slowest thing first (biggest impact).

#### Imported: Common Optimizations

### Database Queries

**Problem: N+1 Queries**
```javascript
// Bad: N+1 queries
const users = await db.users.find();
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await db.posts.find({ userId: user.id }); // N queries
}

// Good: Single query with JOIN
const users = await db.users.find()
  .populate('posts'); // 1 query
```

**Problem: Missing Index**
```sql
-- Check slow query
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
-- Shows: Seq Scan (bad)

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Check again
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
-- Shows: Index Scan (good)
```

**Problem: SELECT ***
```javascript
// Bad: Fetches all columns
const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users');

// Good: Only needed columns
const users = await db.query('SELECT id, name, email FROM users');
```

**Problem: No Pagination**
```javascript
// Bad: Returns all records
const users = await db.users.find();

// Good: Paginated
const users = await db.users.find()
  .limit(20)
  .skip((page - 1) * 20);
```

### API Performance

**Problem: No Caching**
```javascript
// Bad: Hits database every time
app.get('/api/stats', async (req, res) => {
  const stats = await db.stats.calculate(); // Slow
  res.json(stats);
});

// Good: Cache for 5 minutes
const cache = new Map();
app.get('/api/stats', async (req, res) => {
  const cached = cache.get('stats');
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.time < 300000) {
    return res.json(cached.data);
  }
  
  const stats = await db.stats.calculate();
  cache.set('stats', { data: stats, time: Date.now() });
  res.json(stats);
});
```

**Problem: Sequential Operations**
```javascript
// Bad: Sequential (slow)
const user = await getUser(id);
const posts = await getPosts(id);
const comments = await getComments(id);
// Total: 300ms + 200ms + 150ms = 650ms

// Good: Parallel (fast)
const [user, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
  getUser(id),
  getPosts(id),
  getComments(id)
]);
// Total: max(300ms, 200ms, 150ms) = 300ms
```

**Problem: Large Payloads**
```javascript
// Bad: Returns everything
res.json(users); // 5MB response

// Good: Only needed fields
res.json(users.map(u => ({
  id: u.id,
  name: u.name,
  email: u.email
}))); // 500KB response
```

### Frontend Performance

**Problem: Unnecessary Re-renders**
```javascript
// Bad: Re-renders on every parent update
function UserList({ users }) {
  return users.map(user => <UserCard user={user} />);
}

// Good: Memoized
const UserCard = React.memo(({ user }) => {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
});
```

**Problem: Large Bundle**
```javascript
// Bad: Imports entire library
import _ from 'lodash'; // 70KB

// Good: Import only what you need
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'; // 2KB
```

**Problem: No Code Splitting**
```javascript
// Bad: Everything in one bundle
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

// Good: Lazy load
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

**Problem: Unoptimized Images**
```html
<!-- Bad: Large image -->
<img src="photo.jpg" /> <!-- 5MB -->

<!-- Good: Optimized and responsive -->
<img 
  src="photo-small.webp" 
  srcset="photo-small.webp 400w, photo-large.webp 800w"
  loading="lazy"
  width="400"
  height="300"
/> <!-- 50KB -->
```

### Algorithm Optimization

**Problem: Inefficient Algorithm**
```javascript
// Bad: O(n²) - nested loops
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) duplicates.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// Good: O(n) - single pass with Set
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) duplicates.add(item);
    seen.add(item);
  }
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

**Problem: Repeated Calculations**
```javascript
// Bad: Calculates every time
function getTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
// Called 100 times in render

// Good: Memoized
const getTotal = useMemo(() => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}, [items]);
```

### Memory Optimization

**Problem: Memory Leak**
```javascript
// Bad: Event listener not cleaned up
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  // Memory leak!
}, []);

// Good: Cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

**Problem: Large Data in Memory**
```javascript
// Bad: Loads entire file into memory
const data = fs.readFileSync('huge-file.txt'); // 1GB

// Good: Stream it
const stream = fs.createReadStream('huge-file.txt');
stream.on('data', chunk => process(chunk));
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @performance-optimizer to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/performance-optimizer/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/performance-optimizer/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @performance-optimizer using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Measure before optimizing
- Fix the biggest bottleneck first
- Measure after to prove improvement
- Don't sacrifice readability for tiny gains
- Profile in production-like environment
- Consider the 80/20 rule (20% of code causes 80% of slowness)
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/performance-optimizer`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

console.time('query');
const users = await db.users.find();
console.timeEnd('query');
// query: 23ms

// Improvement: 100x faster!
