# Azure Event Grid SDK for Java

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-eventgrid-java` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Azure Event Grid SDK for Java Build event-driven applications using the Azure Event Grid SDK for Java.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Client Creation, Event Types, Core Patterns, Receiving Events, Event Grid Namespaces (MQTT/Pull), Error Handling.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- "Event Grid Java"
- "publish events Azure"
- "CloudEvent SDK"
- "event-driven messaging"
- "pub/sub Azure"
- "webhook events"

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. xml <dependency> <groupId>com.azure</groupId> <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventgrid</artifactId> <version>4.27.0</version> </dependency>
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventgrid</artifactId>
    <version>4.27.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Imported: Client Creation

### EventGridPublisherClient

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherClient;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherClientBuilder;
import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;

// With API Key
EventGridPublisherClient<EventGridEvent> client = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherClient();

// For CloudEvents
EventGridPublisherClient<CloudEvent> cloudClient = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildCloudEventPublisherClient();
```

### With DefaultAzureCredential

```java
import com.azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder;

EventGridPublisherClient<EventGridEvent> client = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherClient();
```

### Async Client

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherAsyncClient;

EventGridPublisherAsyncClient<EventGridEvent> asyncClient = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherAsyncClient();
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-eventgrid-java to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/azure-eventgrid-java/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/azure-eventgrid-java/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-eventgrid-java using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Batch Events: Send multiple events in one call when possible
- Idempotency: Include unique event IDs for deduplication
- Schema Validation: Use strongly-typed event data classes
- Retry Logic: Built-in, but consider dead-letter for failures
- Event Size: Keep events under 1MB (64KB for basic tier)
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-eventgrid-java`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Event Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `EventGridEvent` | Azure Event Grid native schema |
| `CloudEvent` | CNCF CloudEvents 1.0 specification |
| `BinaryData` | Custom schema events |

#### Imported: Core Patterns

### Publish EventGridEvent

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridEvent;
import com.azure.core.util.BinaryData;

EventGridEvent event = new EventGridEvent(
    "resource/path",           // subject
    "MyApp.Events.OrderCreated", // eventType
    BinaryData.fromObject(new OrderData("order-123", 99.99)), // data
    "1.0"                      // dataVersion
);

client.sendEvent(event);
```

### Publish Multiple Events

```java
List<EventGridEvent> events = Arrays.asList(
    new EventGridEvent("orders/1", "Order.Created", 
        BinaryData.fromObject(order1), "1.0"),
    new EventGridEvent("orders/2", "Order.Created", 
        BinaryData.fromObject(order2), "1.0")
);

client.sendEvents(events);
```

### Publish CloudEvent

```java
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEvent;
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEventDataFormat;

CloudEvent cloudEvent = new CloudEvent(
    "/myapp/orders",           // source
    "order.created",           // type
    BinaryData.fromObject(orderData), // data
    CloudEventDataFormat.JSON  // dataFormat
);
cloudEvent.setSubject("orders/12345");
cloudEvent.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());

cloudClient.sendEvent(cloudEvent);
```

### Publish CloudEvents Batch

```java
List<CloudEvent> cloudEvents = Arrays.asList(
    new CloudEvent("/app", "event.type1", BinaryData.fromString("data1"), CloudEventDataFormat.JSON),
    new CloudEvent("/app", "event.type2", BinaryData.fromString("data2"), CloudEventDataFormat.JSON)
);

cloudClient.sendEvents(cloudEvents);
```

### Async Publishing

```java
asyncClient.sendEvent(event)
    .subscribe(
        unused -> System.out.println("Event sent successfully"),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage())
    );

// With multiple events
asyncClient.sendEvents(events)
    .doOnSuccess(unused -> System.out.println("All events sent"))
    .doOnError(error -> System.err.println("Failed: " + error))
    .block(); // Block if needed
```

### Custom Event Data Class

```java
public class OrderData {
    private String orderId;
    private double amount;
    private String customerId;
    
    public OrderData(String orderId, double amount) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.amount = amount;
    }
    
    // Getters and setters
}

// Usage
OrderData order = new OrderData("ORD-123", 150.00);
EventGridEvent event = new EventGridEvent(
    "orders/" + order.getOrderId(),
    "MyApp.Order.Created",
    BinaryData.fromObject(order),
    "1.0"
);
```

#### Imported: Receiving Events

### Parse EventGridEvent

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridEvent;

// From JSON string (e.g., webhook payload)
String jsonPayload = "[{\"id\": \"...\", ...}]";
List<EventGridEvent> events = EventGridEvent.fromString(jsonPayload);

for (EventGridEvent event : events) {
    System.out.println("Event Type: " + event.getEventType());
    System.out.println("Subject: " + event.getSubject());
    System.out.println("Event Time: " + event.getEventTime());
    
    // Get data
    BinaryData data = event.getData();
    OrderData orderData = data.toObject(OrderData.class);
}
```

### Parse CloudEvent

```java
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEvent;

String cloudEventJson = "[{\"specversion\": \"1.0\", ...}]";
List<CloudEvent> cloudEvents = CloudEvent.fromString(cloudEventJson);

for (CloudEvent event : cloudEvents) {
    System.out.println("Type: " + event.getType());
    System.out.println("Source: " + event.getSource());
    System.out.println("ID: " + event.getId());
    
    MyEventData data = event.getData().toObject(MyEventData.class);
}
```

### Handle System Events

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.systemevents.*;

for (EventGridEvent event : events) {
    if (event.getEventType().equals("Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated")) {
        StorageBlobCreatedEventData blobData = 
            event.getData().toObject(StorageBlobCreatedEventData.class);
        System.out.println("Blob URL: " + blobData.getUrl());
    }
}
```

#### Imported: Event Grid Namespaces (MQTT/Pull)

### Receive from Namespace Topic

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.EventGridReceiverClient;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.EventGridReceiverClientBuilder;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.models.*;

EventGridReceiverClient receiverClient = new EventGridReceiverClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<namespace-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<key>"))
    .topicName("my-topic")
    .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
    .buildClient();

// Receive events
ReceiveResult result = receiverClient.receive(10, Duration.ofSeconds(30));

for (ReceiveDetails detail : result.getValue()) {
    CloudEvent event = detail.getEvent();
    System.out.println("Event: " + event.getType());
    
    // Acknowledge the event
    receiverClient.acknowledge(Arrays.asList(detail.getBrokerProperties().getLockToken()));
}
```

### Reject or Release Events

```java
// Reject (don't retry)
receiverClient.reject(Arrays.asList(lockToken));

// Release (retry later)
receiverClient.release(Arrays.asList(lockToken));

// Release with delay
receiverClient.release(Arrays.asList(lockToken), 
    new ReleaseOptions().setDelay(ReleaseDelay.BY_60_SECONDS));
```

#### Imported: Error Handling

```java
import com.azure.core.exception.HttpResponseException;

try {
    client.sendEvent(event);
} catch (HttpResponseException e) {
    System.out.println("Status: " + e.getResponse().getStatusCode());
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```bash
EVENT_GRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT=https://<topic-name>.<region>.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events
