# Rayden UI Design Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/rayden-use` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Rayden UI Design Skill

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Security & Safety Notes, Common Pitfalls, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to build a new Rayden UI component with all its variants in Figma
- You're composing a full screen (dashboard, landing page, auth form, settings, data table) from Rayden patterns
- You want to audit an existing Figma file for design system compliance
- You need to add new variants to an existing Figma component
- You're syncing React component updates back to Figma
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Build and maintain Rayden UI components and screens in Figma via Figma MCP with full design token enforcement.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Build and maintain Rayden UI components and screens directly in Figma using the Figma MCP. The skill enforces the Rayna UI design system — resolved design tokens, craft rules, anti-pattern detection, and visual validation — so every output is mechanically correct and visually premium. Supports three style modes (conservative, balanced, expressive) and includes a dedicated subagent for full-page screen composition.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Verifies environment** — Checks Figma MCP connection and write access via `whoami`
2. **Loads component data** — Reads Rayden component specs, anatomy, and tokens from the `@raydenui/ai` MCP server or installed package
3. **Loads craft rules** — Reads supporting files: resolved token values, craft rules, anti-patterns, and screen layout patterns
4. **Identifies task type** — Determines if building a single component, composing a screen, auditing, or adding variants
5. **Applies style mode** — Adjusts spacing, shadow, typography, and visual weight based on conservative/balanced/expressive mode
6. **Builds with helpers** — Generates Figma Plugin API code using mandatory helper functions (hexToRgb, loadFonts, applyShadow, applyBorder) with auto layout on every frame
7. **Visual validation** — Takes screenshots after each build stage and validates against 8 acceptance criteria (alignment, spacing, color accuracy, hierarchy, radius, shadow, primary action count)

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @rayden-use to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @rayden-use against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @rayden-use for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @rayden-use using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Build a component with all variants

```
/rayden-use Button https://figma.com/file/abc123
```

**Use case:** You're starting a new design system file and need the Button component with all variants (primary, secondary, grey, destructive) in solid and outlined appearances across SM and LG sizes.

### Design a SaaS dashboard

```
/rayden-use dashboard-screen balanced https://figma.com/file/abc123
```

**Use case:** You're designing an analytics dashboard and need a sidebar layout with KPI cards, a data table, and an activity feed — all using consistent Rayden tokens and spacing.

### Build a marketing landing page

```
/rayden-compose landing expressive https://figma.com/file/abc123
```

**Use case:** You need a high-impact landing page with bolder typography, stronger shadows, and asymmetric layouts that avoid the generic "AI-generated" look.

### Audit an existing design for compliance

```
/rayden-use audit https://figma.com/file/abc123
```

**Use case:** You have an existing Figma file and want to check that all colors match Rayden tokens, spacing is on the 4px grid, and radius is concentric.

### Add variants to an existing component

```
/rayden-use add-variants Input https://figma.com/file/abc123
```

**Use case:** The Input component exists in your Figma file but is missing error and success states — the skill reads the existing structure and extends it.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Always provide a Figma file URL as the last argument
- Use balanced mode (default) for most use cases; conservative for dense admin UIs, expressive for marketing pages
- Let the skill take screenshots between build stages — this is how it validates output quality
- Install @raydenui/ai as an MCP server for the richest component data access
- Review the generated output in Figma after completion — the skill validates mechanically but human judgment on aesthetics is still valuable
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/rayden-use`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Security & Safety Notes

- This skill only reads local supporting files and calls the Figma MCP — no external network requests beyond Figma's API
- Requires Figma Dev or Full seat with write access to the target file
- Does not modify files outside of the target Figma document
- All design tokens are bundled in the skill's supporting files — no secrets or credentials involved

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Font not found" error | The skill falls back to Roboto if Inter is unavailable — ensure Inter is loaded in your Figma file for best results |
| Components don't combine as variants | All components must share the same parent frame before calling `combineAsVariants` |
| Colors look wrong | Verify you're using resolved token hex values from tokens.md, not approximations |
| Figma permission denied | Check that your Figma seat is Dev or Full (not Viewer) and the file isn't view-only |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
