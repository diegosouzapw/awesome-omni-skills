# Landing Page Generator

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/landing-page-generator` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Landing Page Generator Generate high-converting landing pages from a product description. Output complete Next.js/React components with multiple section variants, proven copy frameworks, SEO optimization, and performance-first patterns. Not lorem ipsum — actual copy that converts. Target: LCP < 1s · CLS < 0.1 · FID < 100ms Output: TSX components + Tailwind styles + SEO meta + copy variants

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Copy Frameworks, Representative Component: Hero (Centered Gradient — Dark SaaS), Other Section Patterns, SEO Checklist, Performance Targets.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to generate a marketing landing page in Next.js or React.
- The task involves conversion-focused page structure, section variants, Tailwind styling, or SEO-aware copy.
- You want complete landing-page output from a product description rather than isolated UI fragments.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generates high-converting Next.js/React landing pages with Tailwind CSS. Uses PAS, AIDA, and BAB frameworks for optimized copy/components (Heroes, Features, Pricing). Focuses on Core Web Vitals/SEO.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `references/conversion-patterns.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `references/frameworks.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Gather inputs — collect product name, tagline, audience, pain point, key benefit, pricing tiers, design style, and copy framework using the trigger format below. Ask only for missing fields.
2. Analyze brand voice (recommended) — if the user has existing brand content (website copy, blog posts, marketing materials), run it through marketing-skill/content-production/scripts/brandvoiceanalyzer.py to get a voice profile (formality, tone, perspective). Use the profile to inform design style and copy framework selection:
3. formal + professional → enterprise style, AIDA framework
4. casual + friendly → bold-startup style, BAB framework
5. professional + authoritative → dark-saas style, PAS framework
6. casual + conversational → clean-minimal style, BAB framework
7. Select design style — map the user's choice (or infer from brand voice analysis) to one of the four Tailwind class sets in the Design Style Reference.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Generation Workflow

Follow these steps in order for every landing page request:

1. **Gather inputs** — collect product name, tagline, audience, pain point, key benefit, pricing tiers, design style, and copy framework using the trigger format below. Ask only for missing fields.
2. **Analyze brand voice** (recommended) — if the user has existing brand content (website copy, blog posts, marketing materials), run it through `marketing-skill/content-production/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py` to get a voice profile (formality, tone, perspective). Use the profile to inform design style and copy framework selection:
   - formal + professional → **enterprise** style, **AIDA** framework
   - casual + friendly → **bold-startup** style, **BAB** framework
   - professional + authoritative → **dark-saas** style, **PAS** framework
   - casual + conversational → **clean-minimal** style, **BAB** framework
3. **Select design style** — map the user's choice (or infer from brand voice analysis) to one of the four Tailwind class sets in the Design Style Reference.
4. **Apply copy framework** — write all headline and body copy using the chosen framework (PAS / AIDA / BAB) before generating components. Match the voice profile's formality and tone throughout.
5. **Generate sections in order** — Hero → Features → Pricing → FAQ → Testimonials → CTA → Footer. Skip sections not relevant to the product.
6. **Validate against SEO checklist** — run through every item in the SEO Checklist before outputting final code. Fix any gaps inline.
7. **Output final components** — deliver complete, copy-paste-ready TSX files with all Tailwind classes, SEO meta, and structured data included.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @landing-page-generator to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @landing-page-generator against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @landing-page-generator for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @landing-page-generator using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/landing-page-generator`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.



## Related Skills

- `@base` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@calc` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@draw` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.

#### Imported: Copy Frameworks

**PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)**
- H1: Painful state they're in
- Sub: What happens if they don't fix it
- CTA: What you offer
- *Example — H1:* "Your team wastes 3 hours a day on manual reporting" / *Sub:* "Every hour spent on spreadsheets is an hour not closing deals. Your competitors are already automated." / *CTA:* "Automate your reports in 10 minutes →"

**AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)**
- H1: Bold attention-grabbing statement → Sub: Interesting fact or benefit → Features: Desire-building proof points → CTA: Clear action

**BAB (Before → After → Bridge)**
- H1: "[Before state] → [After state]" → Sub: "Here's how [product] bridges the gap" → Features: How it works (the bridge)

#### Imported: Other Section Patterns

### Feature Section (Alternating)

Map over a `features` array with `{ title, description, image, badge }`. Toggle layout direction with `i % 2 === 1 ? "lg:flex-row-reverse" : ""`. Use `<Image>` with explicit `width`/`height` and `rounded-2xl shadow-xl`. Wrap in `<section className="py-24">` with `max-w-6xl` container.

### Pricing Table

Map over a `plans` array with `{ name, price, description, features[], cta, highlighted }`. Highlighted plan gets `border-2 border-violet-500 bg-violet-950/50 ring-4 ring-violet-500/20`; others get `border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900`. Render `null` price as "Custom". Use `<Check>` icon per feature row. Layout: `grid gap-8 lg:grid-cols-3`.

### FAQ with Schema Markup

Inject `FAQPage` JSON-LD via `<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }} />` inside the section. Map FAQs with `{ q, a }` into shadcn `<Accordion>` with `type="single" collapsible`. Container: `max-w-3xl`.

### Testimonials, CTA, Footer

- **Testimonials:** Grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`) or single-quote hero block with avatar, name, role, and quote text.
- **CTA Banner:** Full-width section with headline, subhead, and two buttons (primary + ghost). Add trust signals (money-back guarantee, logo strip) immediately below.
- **Footer:** Logo + nav columns + social links + legal. Use `border-t border-gray-800` separator.

#### Imported: SEO Checklist

- [ ] `<title>` tag: primary keyword + brand (50–60 chars)
- [ ] Meta description: benefit + CTA (150–160 chars)
- [ ] OG image: 1200×630px with product name and tagline
- [ ] H1: one per page, includes primary keyword
- [ ] Structured data: FAQPage, Product, or Organization schema
- [ ] Canonical URL set
- [ ] Image alt text on all `<Image>` components
- [ ] robots.txt and sitemap.xml configured
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP < 1s, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Mobile viewport meta tag present
- [ ] Internal linking to pricing and docs

> **Validation step:** Before outputting final code, verify every checklist item above is satisfied. Fix any gaps inline — do not skip items.

---

#### Imported: Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | < 1s | Preload hero image, use `priority` on Next/Image |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Set explicit width/height on all images |
| FID/INP | < 100ms | Defer non-critical JS, use `loading="lazy"` |
| TTFB | < 200ms | Use ISR or static generation for landing pages |
| Bundle | < 100KB JS | Audit with `@next/bundle-analyzer` |

---

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

- Hero image not preloaded — add `priority` prop to first `<Image>`
- Missing mobile breakpoints — always design mobile-first with `sm:` prefixes
- CTA copy too vague — "Get started" beats "Learn more"; "Start free trial" beats "Sign up"
- Pricing page missing trust signals — add money-back guarantee and testimonials near CTA
- No above-the-fold CTA on mobile — ensure button is visible without scrolling on 375px viewport

---

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
