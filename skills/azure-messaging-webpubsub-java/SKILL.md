# Azure Web PubSub SDK for Java

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-messaging-webpubsub-java` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Azure Web PubSub SDK for Java Build real-time web applications using the Azure Web PubSub SDK for Java.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Client Creation, Key Concepts, Core Patterns, Error Handling, Environment Variables, Client Roles.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- "Web PubSub Java"
- "WebSocket messaging Azure"
- "real-time push notifications"
- "server-sent events"
- "chat application backend"
- "live updates broadcasting"

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. xml <dependency> <groupId>com.azure</groupId> <artifactId>azure-messaging-webpubsub</artifactId> <version>1.5.0</version> </dependency>
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-messaging-webpubsub</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Imported: Client Creation

### With Connection String

```java
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.WebPubSubServiceClient;
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.WebPubSubServiceClientBuilder;

WebPubSubServiceClient client = new WebPubSubServiceClientBuilder()
    .connectionString("<connection-string>")
    .hub("chat")
    .buildClient();
```

### With Access Key

```java
import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;

WebPubSubServiceClient client = new WebPubSubServiceClientBuilder()
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .endpoint("<endpoint>")
    .hub("chat")
    .buildClient();
```

### With DefaultAzureCredential

```java
import com.azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder;

WebPubSubServiceClient client = new WebPubSubServiceClientBuilder()
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .endpoint("<endpoint>")
    .hub("chat")
    .buildClient();
```

### Async Client

```java
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.WebPubSubServiceAsyncClient;

WebPubSubServiceAsyncClient asyncClient = new WebPubSubServiceClientBuilder()
    .connectionString("<connection-string>")
    .hub("chat")
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-messaging-webpubsub-java to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @azure-messaging-webpubsub-java against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @azure-messaging-webpubsub-java for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-messaging-webpubsub-java using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Use Groups: Organize connections into groups for targeted messaging
- User IDs: Associate connections with user IDs for user-level messaging
- Token Expiration: Set appropriate token expiration for security
- Roles: Grant minimal required permissions via roles
- Hub Isolation: Use separate hubs for different application features
- Connection Management: Clean up inactive connections
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-messaging-webpubsub-java`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Key Concepts

- **Hub**: Logical isolation unit for connections
- **Group**: Subset of connections within a hub
- **Connection**: Individual WebSocket client connection
- **User**: Entity that can have multiple connections

#### Imported: Core Patterns

### Send to All Connections

```java
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.models.WebPubSubContentType;

// Send text message
client.sendToAll("Hello everyone!", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN);

// Send JSON
String jsonMessage = "{\"type\": \"notification\", \"message\": \"New update!\"}";
client.sendToAll(jsonMessage, WebPubSubContentType.APPLICATION_JSON);
```

### Send to All with Filter

```java
import com.azure.core.http.rest.RequestOptions;
import com.azure.core.util.BinaryData;

BinaryData message = BinaryData.fromString("Hello filtered users!");

// Filter by userId
client.sendToAllWithResponse(
    message,
    WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN,
    message.getLength(),
    new RequestOptions().addQueryParam("filter", "userId ne 'user1'"));

// Filter by groups
client.sendToAllWithResponse(
    message,
    WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN,
    message.getLength(),
    new RequestOptions().addQueryParam("filter", "'GroupA' in groups and not('GroupB' in groups)"));
```

### Send to Group

```java
// Send to all connections in a group
client.sendToGroup("java-developers", "Hello Java devs!", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN);

// Send JSON to group
String json = "{\"event\": \"update\", \"data\": {\"version\": \"2.0\"}}";
client.sendToGroup("subscribers", json, WebPubSubContentType.APPLICATION_JSON);
```

### Send to Specific Connection

```java
// Send to a specific connection by ID
client.sendToConnection("connectionId123", "Private message", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN);
```

### Send to User

```java
// Send to all connections for a specific user
client.sendToUser("andy", "Hello Andy!", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN);
```

### Manage Groups

```java
// Add connection to group
client.addConnectionToGroup("premium-users", "connectionId123");

// Remove connection from group
client.removeConnectionFromGroup("premium-users", "connectionId123");

// Add user to group (all their connections)
client.addUserToGroup("admin-group", "userId456");

// Remove user from group
client.removeUserFromGroup("admin-group", "userId456");

// Check if user is in group
boolean exists = client.userExistsInGroup("admin-group", "userId456");
```

### Manage Connections

```java
// Check if connection exists
boolean connected = client.connectionExists("connectionId123");

// Close a connection
client.closeConnection("connectionId123");

// Close with reason
client.closeConnection("connectionId123", "Session expired");

// Check if user exists (has any connections)
boolean userOnline = client.userExists("userId456");

// Close all connections for a user
client.closeUserConnections("userId456");

// Close all connections in a group
client.closeGroupConnections("inactive-group");
```

### Generate Client Access Token

```java
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.models.GetClientAccessTokenOptions;
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.models.WebPubSubClientAccessToken;

// Basic token
WebPubSubClientAccessToken token = client.getClientAccessToken(
    new GetClientAccessTokenOptions());
System.out.println("URL: " + token.getUrl());

// With user ID
WebPubSubClientAccessToken userToken = client.getClientAccessToken(
    new GetClientAccessTokenOptions().setUserId("user123"));

// With roles (permissions)
WebPubSubClientAccessToken roleToken = client.getClientAccessToken(
    new GetClientAccessTokenOptions()
        .setUserId("user123")
        .addRole("webpubsub.joinLeaveGroup")
        .addRole("webpubsub.sendToGroup"));

// With groups to join on connect
WebPubSubClientAccessToken groupToken = client.getClientAccessToken(
    new GetClientAccessTokenOptions()
        .setUserId("user123")
        .addGroup("announcements")
        .addGroup("updates"));

// With custom expiration
WebPubSubClientAccessToken expToken = client.getClientAccessToken(
    new GetClientAccessTokenOptions()
        .setUserId("user123")
        .setExpiresAfter(Duration.ofHours(2)));
```

### Grant/Revoke Permissions

```java
import com.azure.messaging.webpubsub.models.WebPubSubPermission;

// Grant permission to send to a group
client.grantPermission(
    WebPubSubPermission.SEND_TO_GROUP,
    "connectionId123",
    new RequestOptions().addQueryParam("targetName", "chat-room"));

// Revoke permission
client.revokePermission(
    WebPubSubPermission.SEND_TO_GROUP,
    "connectionId123",
    new RequestOptions().addQueryParam("targetName", "chat-room"));

// Check permission
boolean hasPermission = client.checkPermission(
    WebPubSubPermission.SEND_TO_GROUP,
    "connectionId123",
    new RequestOptions().addQueryParam("targetName", "chat-room"));
```

### Async Operations

```java
asyncClient.sendToAll("Async message!", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    .subscribe(
        unused -> System.out.println("Message sent"),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage())
    );

asyncClient.sendToGroup("developers", "Group message", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    .doOnSuccess(v -> System.out.println("Sent to group"))
    .doOnError(e -> System.err.println("Failed: " + e))
    .subscribe();
```

#### Imported: Error Handling

```java
import com.azure.core.exception.HttpResponseException;

try {
    client.sendToConnection("invalid-id", "test", WebPubSubContentType.TEXT_PLAIN);
} catch (HttpResponseException e) {
    System.out.println("Status: " + e.getResponse().getStatusCode());
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```

#### Imported: Client Roles

| Role | Permission |
|------|------------|
| `webpubsub.joinLeaveGroup` | Join/leave any group |
| `webpubsub.sendToGroup` | Send to any group |
| `webpubsub.joinLeaveGroup.<group>` | Join/leave specific group |
| `webpubsub.sendToGroup.<group>` | Send to specific group |

#### Imported: Limitations
