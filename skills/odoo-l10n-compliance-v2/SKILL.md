# Odoo Localization & Compliance (l10n)

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-l10n-compliance` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Odoo Localization & Compliance (l10n)

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Country Localization Modules, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Setting up Odoo for a company in a specific country (Mexico, Italy, Spain, US, etc.).
- Configuring country-required e-invoicing (electronic invoice submission to tax authorities).
- Setting up VAT/GST/IVA tax rules with correct fiscal positions.
- Generating required fiscal reports (VAT return, SAF-T, DIAN report).
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Country-specific Odoo localization: tax configuration, e-invoicing (CFDI, FatturaPA, SAF-T), fiscal reporting, and country chart of accounts setup.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Odoo provides localization modules (`l10n_*`) for 80+ countries that configure the correct chart of accounts, tax types, and fiscal reporting. This skill helps you install and configure the right localization, set up country-specific e-invoicing (Mexico CFDI, Italy FatturaPA, Poland SAF-T), and ensure fiscal compliance.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-l10n-compliance` and specify your country and Odoo version.
2. **Install**: Get the exact localization module and configuration steps.
3. **Configure**: Receive tax code setup, fiscal position rules, and reporting guidance.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @odoo-l10n-compliance-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-l10n-compliance-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-l10n-compliance-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @odoo-l10n-compliance-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Configure Mexico CFDI 4.0

```
Step 1: Install module
  Apps → Search "Mexico" → Install "Mexico - Accounting"
  Also install: "Mexico - Electronic Invoicing" (l10n_mx_edi)

Step 2: Configure Company
  Settings → Company → [Your Company]
  Country: Mexico
  RFC: Your RFC number (tax ID)
  Company Type: Moral Person or Physical Person

Step 3: Upload SAT Certificates
  Accounting → Configuration → Certificates → New
  CSD Certificate (.cer file from SAT)
  Private Key (.key file from SAT)
  Password: Your FIEL password

Step 4: Issue a CFDI Invoice
  Create invoice → Confirm → CFDI XML generated automatically
  Sent to SAT → Receive UUID (folio fiscal)
  PDF includes QR code + UUID for buyer verification
```

### Example 2: EU Intra-Community VAT Setup (Any EU Country)

```
Menu: Accounting → Configuration → Taxes → New

Tax Name: EU Intra-Community Sales (0%)
Tax Type: Sales
Tax Scope: Services or Goods
Tax Computation: Fixed
Amount: 0%
Tax Group: Intra-Community

Label on Invoice: "Intra-Community Supply - VAT Exempt per Art. 138 VAT Directive"

Fiscal Position (created separately):
  Name: EU B2B Intra-Community
  Auto-detect: Country Group = Europe + VAT Required = YES
  Tax Mapping: Standard VAT Rate → 0% Intra-Community
```

### Example 3: Install and Validate a Localization

```bash
# Install via CLI (if module not in Apps)
./odoo-bin -d mydb --stop-after-init -i l10n_mx_edi

# Verify in Odoo:
# Apps → Installed → Search "l10n_mx" → Should show as Installed
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ✅ Do: Install the localization module before creating any accounting entries — it sets up the correct accounts.
- ✅ Do: Use Fiscal Positions to automate tax switching for international customers (B2B vs B2C, domestic vs export).
- ✅ Do: Test e-invoicing in the SAT/tax authority test environment before going live.
- ❌ Don't: Manually create a chart of accounts if a localization module exists for your country.
- ❌ Don't: Mix localization tax accounts with custom accounts — it breaks fiscal reports.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-l10n-compliance`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
