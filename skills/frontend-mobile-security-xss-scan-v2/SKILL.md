# XSS Vulnerability Scanner for Frontend Code

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# XSS Vulnerability Scanner for Frontend Code You are a frontend security specialist focusing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability detection and prevention. Analyze React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript code to identify injection points, unsafe DOM manipulation, and improper sanitization.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Context, Requirements, Output Format.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on xss vulnerability scanner for frontend code tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for xss vulnerability scanner for frontend code
- The task is unrelated to xss vulnerability scanner for frontend code
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: You are a frontend security specialist focusing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability detection and prevention. Analyze React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript code to identify injection poi.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Never use innerHTML with user input
2. Prefer textContent for text content
3. Sanitize with DOMPurify before rendering HTML
4. Avoid document.write entirely
5. Validate all URLs before assignment
6. Block javascript: and data: protocols
7. Use URL constructor for validation

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

### 1. XSS Vulnerability Detection

Scan codebase for XSS vulnerabilities using static analysis:

```typescript
interface XSSFinding {
  file: string;
  line: number;
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  type: string;
  vulnerable_code: string;
  description: string;
  fix: string;
  cwe: string;
}

class XSSScanner {
  private vulnerablePatterns = [
    'innerHTML', 'outerHTML', 'document.write',
    'insertAdjacentHTML', 'location.href', 'window.open'
  ];

  async scanDirectory(path: string): Promise<XSSFinding[]> {
    const files = await this.findJavaScriptFiles(path);
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    for (const file of files) {
      const content = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf-8');
      findings.push(...this.scanFile(file, content));
    }

    return findings;
  }

  scanFile(filePath: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    findings.push(...this.detectHTMLManipulation(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectReactVulnerabilities(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectURLVulnerabilities(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectEventHandlerIssues(filePath, content));

    return findings;
  }

  detectHTMLManipulation(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split('\n');

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes('innerHTML') && this.hasUserInput(line)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: 'critical',
          type: 'Unsafe HTML manipulation',
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description: 'User-controlled data in HTML manipulation creates XSS risk',
          fix: 'Use textContent for plain text or sanitize with DOMPurify library',
          cwe: 'CWE-79'
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  detectReactVulnerabilities(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split('\n');

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes('dangerously') && !this.hasSanitization(content)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: 'high',
          type: 'React unsafe HTML rendering',
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description: 'Unsanitized HTML in React component creates XSS vulnerability',
          fix: 'Apply DOMPurify.sanitize() before rendering or use safe alternatives',
          cwe: 'CWE-79'
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  detectURLVulnerabilities(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split('\n');

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes('location.') && this.hasUserInput(line)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: 'high',
          type: 'URL injection',
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description: 'User input in URL assignment can execute malicious code',
          fix: 'Validate URLs and enforce http/https protocols only',
          cwe: 'CWE-79'
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  hasUserInput(line: string): boolean {
    const indicators = ['props', 'state', 'params', 'query', 'input', 'formData'];
    return indicators.some(indicator => line.includes(indicator));
  }

  hasSanitization(content: string): boolean {
    return content.includes('DOMPurify') || content.includes('sanitize');
  }
}
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Detection

```typescript
class ReactXSSScanner {
  scanReactComponent(code: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    // Check for unsafe React patterns
    const unsafePatterns = [
      'dangerouslySetInnerHTML',
      'createMarkup',
      'rawHtml'
    ];

    unsafePatterns.forEach(pattern => {
      if (code.includes(pattern) && !code.includes('DOMPurify')) {
        findings.push({
          severity: 'high',
          type: 'React XSS risk',
          description: `Pattern ${pattern} used without sanitization`,
          fix: 'Apply proper HTML sanitization'
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }
}

class VueXSSScanner {
  scanVueTemplate(template: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    if (template.includes('v-html')) {
      findings.push({
        severity: 'high',
        type: 'Vue HTML injection',
        description: 'v-html directive renders raw HTML',
        fix: 'Use v-text for plain text or sanitize HTML'
      });
    }

    return findings;
  }
}
```

### 3. Secure Coding Examples

```typescript
class SecureCodingGuide {
  getSecurePattern(vulnerability: string): string {
    const patterns = {
      html_manipulation: `
// SECURE: Use textContent for plain text
element.textContent = userInput;

// SECURE: Sanitize HTML when needed
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
element.innerHTML = clean;`,

      url_handling: `
// SECURE: Validate and sanitize URLs
function sanitizeURL(url: string): string {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    if (['http:', 'https:'].includes(parsed.protocol)) {
      return parsed.href;
    }
  } catch {}
  return '#';
}`,

      react_rendering: `
// SECURE: Sanitize before rendering
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const Component = ({ html }) => (
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(html)
  }} />
);`
    };

    return patterns[vulnerability] || 'No secure pattern available';
  }
}
```

### 4. Automated Scanning Integration

```bash
# ESLint with security plugin
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-security
eslint . --plugin security

# Semgrep for XSS patterns
semgrep --config=p/xss --json

# Custom XSS scanner
node xss-scanner.js --path=src --format=json
```

### 5. Report Generation

```typescript
class XSSReportGenerator {
  generateReport(findings: XSSFinding[]): string {
    const grouped = this.groupBySeverity(findings);

    let report = '# XSS Vulnerability Scan Report\n\n';
    report += `Total Findings: ${findings.length}\n\n`;

    for (const [severity, issues] of Object.entries(grouped)) {
      report += `## ${severity.toUpperCase()} (${issues.length})\n\n`;

      for (const issue of issues) {
        report += `- **${issue.type}**\n`;
        report += `  File: ${issue.file}:${issue.line}\n`;
        report += `  Fix: ${issue.fix}\n\n`;
      }
    }

    return report;
  }

  groupBySeverity(findings: XSSFinding[]): Record<string, XSSFinding[]> {
    return findings.reduce((acc, finding) => {
      if (!acc[finding.severity]) acc[finding.severity] = [];
      acc[finding.severity].push(finding);
      return acc;
    }, {} as Record<string, XSSFinding[]>);
  }
}
```

### 6. Prevention Checklist

**HTML Manipulation**
- Never use innerHTML with user input
- Prefer textContent for text content
- Sanitize with DOMPurify before rendering HTML
- Avoid document.write entirely

**URL Handling**
- Validate all URLs before assignment
- Block javascript: and data: protocols
- Use URL constructor for validation
- Sanitize href attributes

**Event Handlers**
- Use addEventListener instead of inline handlers
- Sanitize all event handler input
- Avoid string-to-code patterns

**Framework-Specific**
- React: Sanitize before using unsafe APIs
- Vue: Prefer v-text over v-html
- Angular: Use built-in sanitization
- Avoid bypassing framework security features

#### Imported: Context

The user needs comprehensive XSS vulnerability scanning for client-side code, identifying dangerous patterns like unsafe HTML manipulation, URL handling issues, and improper user input rendering. Focus on context-aware detection and framework-specific security patterns.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/frontend-mobile-security-xss-scan`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
