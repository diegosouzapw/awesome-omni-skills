# Azure Event Grid SDK for Java

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-eventgrid-java` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Azure Event Grid SDK for Java Build event-driven applications using the Azure Event Grid SDK for Java.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Client Creation, Event Types, Core Patterns, Receiving Events, Event Grid Namespaces (MQTT/Pull), Error Handling.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- "Event Grid Java"
- "publish events Azure"
- "CloudEvent SDK"
- "event-driven messaging"
- "pub/sub Azure"
- "webhook events"

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. xml <dependency> <groupId>com.azure</groupId> <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventgrid</artifactId> <version>4.27.0</version> </dependency>
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventgrid</artifactId>
    <version>4.27.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Imported: Client Creation

### EventGridPublisherClient

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherClient;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherClientBuilder;
import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;

// With API Key
EventGridPublisherClient<EventGridEvent> client = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherClient();

// For CloudEvents
EventGridPublisherClient<CloudEvent> cloudClient = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildCloudEventPublisherClient();
```

### With DefaultAzureCredential

```java
import com.azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder;

EventGridPublisherClient<EventGridEvent> client = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherClient();
```

### Async Client

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherAsyncClient;

EventGridPublisherAsyncClient<EventGridEvent> asyncClient = new EventGridPublisherClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<topic-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>"))
    .buildEventGridEventPublisherAsyncClient();
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-eventgrid-java-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @azure-eventgrid-java-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @azure-eventgrid-java-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-eventgrid-java-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Batch Events: Send multiple events in one call when possible
- Idempotency: Include unique event IDs for deduplication
- Schema Validation: Use strongly-typed event data classes
- Retry Logic: Built-in, but consider dead-letter for failures
- Event Size: Keep events under 1MB (64KB for basic tier)
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-eventgrid-java`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Event Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `EventGridEvent` | Azure Event Grid native schema |
| `CloudEvent` | CNCF CloudEvents 1.0 specification |
| `BinaryData` | Custom schema events |

#### Imported: Core Patterns

### Publish EventGridEvent

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridEvent;
import com.azure.core.util.BinaryData;

EventGridEvent event = new EventGridEvent(
    "resource/path",           // subject
    "MyApp.Events.OrderCreated", // eventType
    BinaryData.fromObject(new OrderData("order-123", 99.99)), // data
    "1.0"                      // dataVersion
);

client.sendEvent(event);
```

### Publish Multiple Events

```java
List<EventGridEvent> events = Arrays.asList(
    new EventGridEvent("orders/1", "Order.Created",
        BinaryData.fromObject(order1), "1.0"),
    new EventGridEvent("orders/2", "Order.Created",
        BinaryData.fromObject(order2), "1.0")
);

client.sendEvents(events);
```

### Publish CloudEvent

```java
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEvent;
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEventDataFormat;

CloudEvent cloudEvent = new CloudEvent(
    "/myapp/orders",           // source
    "order.created",           // type
    BinaryData.fromObject(orderData), // data
    CloudEventDataFormat.JSON  // dataFormat
);
cloudEvent.setSubject("orders/12345");
cloudEvent.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());

cloudClient.sendEvent(cloudEvent);
```

### Publish CloudEvents Batch

```java
List<CloudEvent> cloudEvents = Arrays.asList(
    new CloudEvent("/app", "event.type1", BinaryData.fromString("data1"), CloudEventDataFormat.JSON),
    new CloudEvent("/app", "event.type2", BinaryData.fromString("data2"), CloudEventDataFormat.JSON)
);

cloudClient.sendEvents(cloudEvents);
```

### Async Publishing

```java
asyncClient.sendEvent(event)
    .subscribe(
        unused -> System.out.println("Event sent successfully"),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage())
    );

// With multiple events
asyncClient.sendEvents(events)
    .doOnSuccess(unused -> System.out.println("All events sent"))
    .doOnError(error -> System.err.println("Failed: " + error))
    .block(); // Block if needed
```

### Custom Event Data Class

```java
public class OrderData {
    private String orderId;
    private double amount;
    private String customerId;

    public OrderData(String orderId, double amount) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}

// Usage
OrderData order = new OrderData("ORD-123", 150.00);
EventGridEvent event = new EventGridEvent(
    "orders/" + order.getOrderId(),
    "MyApp.Order.Created",
    BinaryData.fromObject(order),
    "1.0"
);
```

#### Imported: Receiving Events

### Parse EventGridEvent

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridEvent;

// From JSON string (e.g., webhook payload)
String jsonPayload = "[{\"id\": \"...\", ...}]";
List<EventGridEvent> events = EventGridEvent.fromString(jsonPayload);

for (EventGridEvent event : events) {
    System.out.println("Event Type: " + event.getEventType());
    System.out.println("Subject: " + event.getSubject());
    System.out.println("Event Time: " + event.getEventTime());

    // Get data
    BinaryData data = event.getData();
    OrderData orderData = data.toObject(OrderData.class);
}
```

### Parse CloudEvent

```java
import com.azure.core.models.CloudEvent;

String cloudEventJson = "[{\"specversion\": \"1.0\", ...}]";
List<CloudEvent> cloudEvents = CloudEvent.fromString(cloudEventJson);

for (CloudEvent event : cloudEvents) {
    System.out.println("Type: " + event.getType());
    System.out.println("Source: " + event.getSource());
    System.out.println("ID: " + event.getId());

    MyEventData data = event.getData().toObject(MyEventData.class);
}
```

### Handle System Events

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.systemevents.*;

for (EventGridEvent event : events) {
    if (event.getEventType().equals("Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated")) {
        StorageBlobCreatedEventData blobData =
            event.getData().toObject(StorageBlobCreatedEventData.class);
        System.out.println("Blob URL: " + blobData.getUrl());
    }
}
```

#### Imported: Event Grid Namespaces (MQTT/Pull)

### Receive from Namespace Topic

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.EventGridReceiverClient;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.EventGridReceiverClientBuilder;
import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.namespaces.models.*;

EventGridReceiverClient receiverClient = new EventGridReceiverClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<namespace-endpoint>")
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential("<key>"))
    .topicName("my-topic")
    .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
    .buildClient();

// Receive events
ReceiveResult result = receiverClient.receive(10, Duration.ofSeconds(30));

for (ReceiveDetails detail : result.getValue()) {
    CloudEvent event = detail.getEvent();
    System.out.println("Event: " + event.getType());

    // Acknowledge the event
    receiverClient.acknowledge(Arrays.asList(detail.getBrokerProperties().getLockToken()));
}
```

### Reject or Release Events

```java
// Reject (don't retry)
receiverClient.reject(Arrays.asList(lockToken));

// Release (retry later)
receiverClient.release(Arrays.asList(lockToken));

// Release with delay
receiverClient.release(Arrays.asList(lockToken),
    new ReleaseOptions().setDelay(ReleaseDelay.BY_60_SECONDS));
```

#### Imported: Error Handling

```java
import com.azure.core.exception.HttpResponseException;

try {
    client.sendEvent(event);
} catch (HttpResponseException e) {
    System.out.println("Status: " + e.getResponse().getStatusCode());
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```bash
EVENT_GRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT=https://<topic-name>.<region>.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events
EVENT_GRID_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
```

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
