# Prometheus Configuration

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/prometheus-configuration` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Prometheus Configuration Complete guide to Prometheus setup, metric collection, scrape configuration, and recording rules.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, Prometheus Architecture, Configuration File, Scrape Configurations, Validation, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to prometheus configuration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Set up Prometheus monitoring
- Configure metric scraping
- Create recording rules
- Design alert rules

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. "9090:9090"
6. ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
7. prometheus-data:/prometheus

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

#### Imported: Installation

### Kubernetes with Helm

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --create-namespace \
  --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.retention=30d \
  --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.storageVolumeSize=50Gi
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - prometheus-data:/prometheus
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d'

volumes:
  prometheus-data:
```

#### Imported: Purpose

Configure Prometheus for comprehensive metric collection, alerting, and monitoring of infrastructure and applications.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @prometheus-configuration to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @prometheus-configuration against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @prometheus-configuration for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @prometheus-configuration using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Recording Rules

Create pre-computed metrics for frequently queried expressions:

```yaml
# /etc/prometheus/rules/recording_rules.yml
groups:
  - name: api_metrics
    interval: 15s
    rules:
      # HTTP request rate per service
      - record: job:http_requests:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

      # Error rate percentage
      - record: job:http_requests_errors:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))

      - record: job:http_requests_error_rate:percentage
        expr: |
          (job:http_requests_errors:rate5m / job:http_requests:rate5m) * 100

      # P95 latency
      - record: job:http_request_duration:p95
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.95,
            sum by (job, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
          )

  - name: resource_metrics
    interval: 30s
    rules:
      # CPU utilization percentage
      - record: instance:node_cpu:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

      # Memory utilization percentage
      - record: instance:node_memory:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - ((node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100)

      # Disk usage percentage
      - record: instance:node_disk:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes) * 100)
```

#### Imported: Best Practices

1. **Use consistent naming** for metrics (prefix_name_unit)
2. **Set appropriate scrape intervals** (15-60s typical)
3. **Use recording rules** for expensive queries
4. **Implement high availability** (multiple Prometheus instances)
5. **Configure retention** based on storage capacity
6. **Use relabeling** for metric cleanup
7. **Monitor Prometheus itself**
8. **Implement federation** for large deployments
9. **Use Thanos/Cortex** for long-term storage
10. **Document custom metrics**

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/prometheus-configuration`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes
