# Data Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/data-engineering-data-pipeline` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Data Pipeline Architecture You are a data pipeline architecture expert specializing in scalable, reliable, and cost-effective data pipelines for batch and streaming data processing.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Requirements, Core Capabilities, Output Deliverables, Success Criteria, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on data pipeline architecture tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for data pipeline architecture
- The task is unrelated to data pipeline architecture
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: You are a data pipeline architecture expert specializing in scalable, reliable, and cost-effective data pipelines for batch and streaming data processing.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Assess: sources, volume, latency requirements, targets
2. Select pattern: ETL (transform before load), ELT (load then transform), Lambda (batch + speed layers), Kappa (stream-only), Lakehouse (unified)
3. Design flow: sources → ingestion → processing → storage → serving
4. Add observability touchpoints
5. Incremental loading with watermark columns
6. Retry logic with exponential backoff
7. Schema validation and dead letter queue for invalid records

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

### 1. Architecture Design
- Assess: sources, volume, latency requirements, targets
- Select pattern: ETL (transform before load), ELT (load then transform), Lambda (batch + speed layers), Kappa (stream-only), Lakehouse (unified)
- Design flow: sources → ingestion → processing → storage → serving
- Add observability touchpoints

### 2. Ingestion Implementation
**Batch**
- Incremental loading with watermark columns
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

- SLA monitoring and email alerts
- Incremental execution with execution_date
- Retry with exponential backoff

**Prefect**
- Task caching for idempotency
- Parallel execution with .submit()
- Artifacts for visibility
- Automatic retries with configurable delays

### 4. Transformation with dbt
- Staging layer: incremental materialization, deduplication, late-arriving data handling
- Marts layer: dimensional models, aggregations, business logic
- Tests: unique, not_null, relationships, accepted_values, custom data quality tests
- Sources: freshness checks, loaded_at_field tracking
- Incremental strategy: merge or delete+insert

### 5. Data Quality Framework
**Great Expectations**
- Table-level: row count, column count
- Column-level: uniqueness, nullability, type validation, value sets, ranges
- Checkpoints for validation execution
- Data docs for documentation
- Failure notifications

**dbt Tests**
- Schema tests in YAML
- Custom data quality tests with dbt-expectations
- Test results tracked in metadata

### 6. Storage Strategy
**Delta Lake**
- ACID transactions with append/overwrite/merge modes
- Upsert with predicate-based matching
- Time travel for historical queries
- Optimize: compact small files, Z-order clustering
- Vacuum to remove old files

**Apache Iceberg**
- Partitioning and sort order optimization
- MERGE INTO for upserts
- Snapshot isolation and time travel
- File compaction with binpack strategy
- Snapshot expiration for cleanup

### 7. Monitoring & Cost Optimization
**Monitoring**
- Track: records processed/failed, data size, execution time, success/failure rates
- CloudWatch metrics and custom namespaces
- SNS alerts for critical/warning/info events
- Data freshness checks
- Performance trend analysis

**Cost Optimization**
- Partitioning: date/entity-based, avoid over-partitioning (keep >1GB)
- File sizes: 512MB-1GB for Parquet
- Lifecycle policies: hot (Standard) → warm (IA) → cold (Glacier)
- Compute: spot instances for batch, on-demand for streaming, serverless for adhoc
- Query optimization: partition pruning, clustering, predicate pushdown

#### Imported: Requirements

$ARGUMENTS

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @data-engineering-data-pipeline to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/data-engineering-data-pipeline/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/data-engineering-data-pipeline/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @data-engineering-data-pipeline using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Example: Minimal Batch Pipeline

```python
# Batch ingestion with validation
from batch_ingestion import BatchDataIngester
from storage.delta_lake_manager import DeltaLakeManager
from data_quality.expectations_suite import DataQualityFramework

ingester = BatchDataIngester(config={})

# Extract with incremental loading
df = ingester.extract_from_database(
    connection_string='postgresql://host:5432/db',
    query='SELECT * FROM orders',
    watermark_column='updated_at',
    last_watermark=last_run_timestamp
)

# Validate
schema = {'required_fields': ['id', 'user_id'], 'dtypes': {'id': 'int64'}}
df = ingester.validate_and_clean(df, schema)

# Data quality checks
dq = DataQualityFramework()
result = dq.validate_dataframe(df, suite_name='orders_suite', data_asset_name='orders')

# Write to Delta Lake
delta_mgr = DeltaLakeManager(storage_path='s3://lake')
delta_mgr.create_or_update_table(
    df=df,
    table_name='orders',
    partition_columns=['order_date'],
    mode='append'
)

# Save failed records
ingester.save_dead_letter_queue('s3://lake/dlq/orders')
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/data-engineering-data-pipeline`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
