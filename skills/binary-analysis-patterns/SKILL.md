# Binary Analysis Patterns

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/binary-analysis-patterns` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Binary Analysis Patterns Comprehensive patterns and techniques for analyzing compiled binaries, understanding assembly code, and reconstructing program logic.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Disassembly Fundamentals, Control Flow Patterns, Data Structure Patterns, Common Code Patterns, Decompilation Patterns, Ghidra Analysis Tips.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on binary analysis patterns tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for binary analysis patterns
- The task is unrelated to binary analysis patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Comprehensive patterns and techniques for analyzing compiled binaries, understanding assembly code, and reconstructing program logic.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

#### Imported: Disassembly Fundamentals

### x86-64 Instruction Patterns

#### Function Prologue/Epilogue
```asm
; Standard prologue
push rbp           ; Save base pointer
mov rbp, rsp       ; Set up stack frame
sub rsp, 0x20      ; Allocate local variables

; Leaf function (no calls)
; May skip frame pointer setup
sub rsp, 0x18      ; Just allocate locals

; Standard epilogue
mov rsp, rbp       ; Restore stack pointer
pop rbp            ; Restore base pointer
ret

; Leave instruction (equivalent)
leave              ; mov rsp, rbp; pop rbp
ret
```

#### Calling Conventions

**System V AMD64 (Linux, macOS)**
```asm
; Arguments: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, then stack
; Return: RAX (and RDX for 128-bit)
; Caller-saved: RAX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, R8-R11
; Callee-saved: RBX, RBP, R12-R15

; Example: func(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
mov rdi, [a]       ; 1st arg
mov rsi, [b]       ; 2nd arg
mov rdx, [c]       ; 3rd arg
mov rcx, [d]       ; 4th arg
mov r8, [e]        ; 5th arg
mov r9, [f]        ; 6th arg
push [g]           ; 7th arg on stack
call func
```

**Microsoft x64 (Windows)**
```asm
; Arguments: RCX, RDX, R8, R9, then stack
; Shadow space: 32 bytes reserved on stack
; Return: RAX

; Example: func(a, b, c, d, e)
sub rsp, 0x28      ; Shadow space + alignment
mov rcx, [a]       ; 1st arg
mov rdx, [b]       ; 2nd arg
mov r8, [c]        ; 3rd arg
mov r9, [d]        ; 4th arg
mov [rsp+0x20], [e] ; 5th arg on stack
call func
add rsp, 0x28
```

### ARM Assembly Patterns

#### ARM64 (AArch64) Calling Convention
```asm
; Arguments: X0-X7
; Return: X0 (and X1 for 128-bit)
; Frame pointer: X29
; Link register: X30

; Function prologue
stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!  ; Save FP and LR
mov x29, sp                 ; Set frame pointer

; Function epilogue
ldp x29, x30, [sp], #16    ; Restore FP and LR
ret
```

#### ARM32 Calling Convention
```asm
; Arguments: R0-R3, then stack
; Return: R0 (and R1 for 64-bit)
; Link register: LR (R14)

; Function prologue
push {fp, lr}
add fp, sp, #4

; Function epilogue
pop {fp, pc}    ; Return by popping PC
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @binary-analysis-patterns to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/binary-analysis-patterns/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/binary-analysis-patterns/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @binary-analysis-patterns using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Initial triage: File type, architecture, imports/exports
- String analysis: Identify interesting strings, error messages
- Function identification: Entry points, exports, cross-references
- Control flow mapping: Understand program structure
- Data structure recovery: Identify structs, arrays, globals
- Algorithm identification: Crypto, hashing, compression
- Documentation: Comments, renamed symbols, type definitions

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Initial triage**: File type, architecture, imports/exports
2. **String analysis**: Identify interesting strings, error messages
3. **Function identification**: Entry points, exports, cross-references
4. **Control flow mapping**: Understand program structure
5. **Data structure recovery**: Identify structs, arrays, globals
6. **Algorithm identification**: Crypto, hashing, compression
7. **Documentation**: Comments, renamed symbols, type definitions

### Common Pitfalls

- **Optimizer artifacts**: Code may not match source structure
- **Inline functions**: Functions may be expanded inline
- **Tail call optimization**: `jmp` instead of `call` + `ret`
- **Dead code**: Unreachable code from optimization
- **Position-independent code**: RIP-relative addressing

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/binary-analysis-patterns`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Control Flow Patterns

### Conditional Branches

```asm
; if (a == b)
cmp eax, ebx
jne skip_block
; ... if body ...
skip_block:

; if (a < b) - signed
cmp eax, ebx
jge skip_block    ; Jump if greater or equal
; ... if body ...
skip_block:

; if (a < b) - unsigned
cmp eax, ebx
jae skip_block    ; Jump if above or equal
; ... if body ...
skip_block:
```

### Loop Patterns

```asm
; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
xor ecx, ecx           ; i = 0
loop_start:
cmp ecx, [n]           ; i < n
jge loop_end
; ... loop body ...
inc ecx                ; i++
jmp loop_start
loop_end:

; while (condition)
jmp loop_check
loop_body:
; ... body ...
loop_check:
cmp eax, ebx
jl loop_body

; do-while
loop_body:
; ... body ...
cmp eax, ebx
jl loop_body
```

### Switch Statement Patterns

```asm
; Jump table pattern
mov eax, [switch_var]
cmp eax, max_case
ja default_case
jmp [jump_table + eax*8]

; Sequential comparison (small switch)
cmp eax, 1
je case_1
cmp eax, 2
je case_2
cmp eax, 3
je case_3
jmp default_case
```

#### Imported: Data Structure Patterns

### Array Access

```asm
; array[i] - 4-byte elements
mov eax, [rbx + rcx*4]        ; rbx=base, rcx=index

; array[i] - 8-byte elements
mov rax, [rbx + rcx*8]

; Multi-dimensional array[i][j]
; arr[i][j] = base + (i * cols + j) * element_size
imul eax, [cols]
add eax, [j]
mov edx, [rbx + rax*4]
```

### Structure Access

```c
struct Example {
    int a;      // offset 0
    char b;     // offset 4
    // padding  // offset 5-7
    long c;     // offset 8
    short d;    // offset 16
};
```

```asm
; Accessing struct fields
mov rdi, [struct_ptr]
mov eax, [rdi]         ; s->a (offset 0)
movzx eax, byte [rdi+4] ; s->b (offset 4)
mov rax, [rdi+8]       ; s->c (offset 8)
movzx eax, word [rdi+16] ; s->d (offset 16)
```

### Linked List Traversal

```asm
; while (node != NULL)
list_loop:
test rdi, rdi          ; node == NULL?
jz list_done
; ... process node ...
mov rdi, [rdi+8]       ; node = node->next (assuming next at offset 8)
jmp list_loop
list_done:
```

#### Imported: Common Code Patterns

### String Operations

```asm
; strlen pattern
xor ecx, ecx
strlen_loop:
cmp byte [rdi + rcx], 0
je strlen_done
inc ecx
jmp strlen_loop
strlen_done:
; ecx contains length

; strcpy pattern
strcpy_loop:
mov al, [rsi]
mov [rdi], al
test al, al
jz strcpy_done
inc rsi
inc rdi
jmp strcpy_loop
strcpy_done:

; memcpy using rep movsb
mov rdi, dest
mov rsi, src
mov rcx, count
rep movsb
```

### Arithmetic Patterns

```asm
; Multiplication by constant
; x * 3
lea eax, [rax + rax*2]

; x * 5
lea eax, [rax + rax*4]

; x * 10
lea eax, [rax + rax*4]  ; x * 5
add eax, eax            ; * 2

; Division by power of 2 (signed)
mov eax, [x]
cdq                     ; Sign extend to EDX:EAX
and edx, 7              ; For divide by 8
add eax, edx            ; Adjust for negative
sar eax, 3              ; Arithmetic shift right

; Modulo power of 2
and eax, 7              ; x % 8
```

### Bit Manipulation

```asm
; Test specific bit
test eax, 0x80          ; Test bit 7
jnz bit_set

; Set bit
or eax, 0x10            ; Set bit 4

; Clear bit
and eax, ~0x10          ; Clear bit 4

; Toggle bit
xor eax, 0x10           ; Toggle bit 4

; Count leading zeros
bsr eax, ecx            ; Bit scan reverse
xor eax, 31             ; Convert to leading zeros

; Population count (popcnt)
popcnt eax, ecx         ; Count set bits
```

#### Imported: Decompilation Patterns

### Variable Recovery

```asm
; Local variable at rbp-8
mov qword [rbp-8], rax  ; Store to local
mov rax, [rbp-8]        ; Load from local

; Stack-allocated array
lea rax, [rbp-0x40]     ; Array starts at rbp-0x40
mov [rax], edx          ; array[0] = value
mov [rax+4], ecx        ; array[1] = value
```

### Function Signature Recovery

```asm
; Identify parameters by register usage
func:
    ; rdi used as first param (System V)
    mov [rbp-8], rdi    ; Save param to local
    ; rsi used as second param
    mov [rbp-16], rsi
    ; Identify return by RAX at end
    mov rax, [result]
    ret
```

### Type Recovery

```asm
; 1-byte operations suggest char/bool
movzx eax, byte [rdi]   ; Zero-extend byte
movsx eax, byte [rdi]   ; Sign-extend byte

; 2-byte operations suggest short
movzx eax, word [rdi]
movsx eax, word [rdi]

; 4-byte operations suggest int/float
mov eax, [rdi]
movss xmm0, [rdi]       ; Float

; 8-byte operations suggest long/double/pointer
mov rax, [rdi]
movsd xmm0, [rdi]       ; Double
```

### Improving Decompilation

```java
// In Ghidra scripting
// Fix function signature
Function func = getFunctionAt(toAddr(0x401000));
func.setReturnType(IntegerDataType.dataType, SourceType.USER_DEFINED);

// Create structure type
StructureDataType struct = new StructureDataType("MyStruct", 0);
struct.add(IntegerDataType.dataType, "field_a", null);
struct.add(PointerDataType.dataType, "next", null);

// Apply to memory
createData(toAddr(0x601000), struct);
```

# Find all calls to dangerous functions
for func in currentProgram.getFunctionManager().getFunctions(True):
    for ref in getReferencesTo(func.getEntryPoint()):
        if func.getName() in ["strcpy", "sprintf", "gets"]:
