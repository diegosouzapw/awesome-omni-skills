# Prisma Expert

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/prisma-expert` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Prisma Expert You are an expert in Prisma ORM with deep knowledge of schema design, migrations, query optimization, relations modeling, and database operations across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Code Review Checklist, Anti-Patterns to Avoid, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Raw SQL optimization: Stop and recommend postgres-expert or mongodb-expert
- Database server configuration: Stop and recommend database-expert
- Connection pooling at infrastructure level: Stop and recommend devops-expert
- Identify the Prisma-specific issue category
- Check for common anti-patterns in schema or queries
- Apply progressive fixes (minimal → better → complete)

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Code Review Checklist

### Schema Quality
- [ ] All models have appropriate `@id` and primary keys
- [ ] Relations use explicit `@relation` with `fields` and `references`
- [ ] Cascade behaviors defined (`onDelete`, `onUpdate`)
- [ ] Indexes added for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Enums used for fixed value sets
- [ ] `@@map` used for table naming conventions

### Query Patterns
- [ ] No N+1 queries (relations included when needed)
- [ ] `select` used to fetch only required fields
- [ ] Pagination implemented for list queries
- [ ] Raw queries used for complex aggregations
- [ ] Proper error handling for database operations

### Performance
- [ ] Connection pooling configured appropriately
- [ ] Indexes exist for WHERE clause fields
- [ ] Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- [ ] Query logging enabled in development
- [ ] Slow queries identified and optimized

### Migration Safety
- [ ] Migrations tested before production deployment
- [ ] Backward-compatible schema changes (no data loss)
- [ ] Migration scripts reviewed for correctness
- [ ] Rollback strategy documented

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @prisma-expert to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @prisma-expert against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @prisma-expert for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @prisma-expert using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/prisma-expert`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Problem Playbooks

### Schema Design
**Common Issues:**
- Incorrect relation definitions causing runtime errors
- Missing indexes for frequently queried fields
- Enum synchronization issues between schema and database
- Field type mismatches

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Validate schema
npx prisma validate

# Check for schema drift
npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --to-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma

# Format schema
npx prisma format
```

**Prioritized Fixes:**
1. **Minimal**: Fix relation annotations, add missing `@relation` directives
2. **Better**: Add proper indexes with `@@index`, optimize field types
3. **Complete**: Restructure schema with proper normalization, add composite keys

**Best Practices:**
```prisma
// Good: Explicit relations with clear naming
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  posts     Post[]   @relation("UserPosts")
  profile   Profile? @relation("UserProfile")

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([email])
  @@map("users")
}

model Post {
  id       String @id @default(cuid())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation("UserPosts", fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId String

  @@index([authorId])
  @@map("posts")
}
```

### Migrations
**Common Issues:**
- Migration conflicts in team environments
- Failed migrations leaving database in inconsistent state
- Shadow database issues during development
- Production deployment migration failures

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# View pending migrations
ls -la prisma/migrations/

# Check migration history table
# (use database-specific command)
```

**Prioritized Fixes:**
1. **Minimal**: Reset development database with `prisma migrate reset`
2. **Better**: Manually fix migration SQL, use `prisma migrate resolve`
3. **Complete**: Squash migrations, create baseline for fresh setup

**Safe Migration Workflow:**
```bash
# Development
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name

# Production (never use migrate dev!)
npx prisma migrate deploy

# If migration fails in production
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "migration_name"
# or
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back "migration_name"
```

### Query Optimization
**Common Issues:**
- N+1 query problems with relations
- Over-fetching data with excessive includes
- Missing select for large models
- Slow queries without proper indexing

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Enable query logging
# In schema.prisma or client initialization:
# log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error']
```

```typescript
// Enable query events
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    { emit: 'event', level: 'query' },
  ],
});

prisma.$on('query', (e) => {
  console.log('Query: ' + e.query);
  console.log('Duration: ' + e.duration + 'ms');
});
```

**Prioritized Fixes:**
1. **Minimal**: Add includes for related data to avoid N+1
2. **Better**: Use select to fetch only needed fields
3. **Complete**: Use raw queries for complex aggregations, implement caching

**Optimized Query Patterns:**
```typescript
// BAD: N+1 problem
const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
for (const user of users) {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({ where: { authorId: user.id } });
}

// GOOD: Include relations
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: { posts: true }
});

// BETTER: Select only needed fields
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    email: true,
    posts: {
      select: { id: true, title: true }
    }
  }
});

// BEST for complex queries: Use $queryRaw
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT u.id, u.email, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN posts p ON p.author_id = u.id
  GROUP BY u.id
`;
```

### Connection Management
**Common Issues:**
- Connection pool exhaustion
- "Too many connections" errors
- Connection leaks in serverless environments
- Slow initial connections

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check current connections (PostgreSQL)
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'your_db';"
```

**Prioritized Fixes:**
1. **Minimal**: Configure connection limit in DATABASE_URL
2. **Better**: Implement proper connection lifecycle management
3. **Complete**: Use connection pooler (PgBouncer) for high-traffic apps

**Connection Configuration:**
```typescript
// For serverless (Vercel, AWS Lambda)
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ||
  new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query'] : [],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

// Graceful shutdown
process.on('beforeExit', async () => {
  await prisma.$disconnect();
});
```

```env
# Connection URL with pool settings
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=10"
```

- https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-vercel

### Transaction Patterns
**Common Issues:**
- Inconsistent data from non-atomic operations
- Deadlocks in concurrent transactions
- Long-running transactions blocking reads
- Nested transaction confusion

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
// Check for transaction issues
try {
  const result = await prisma.$transaction([...]);
} catch (e) {
  if (e.code === 'P2034') {
    console.log('Transaction conflict detected');
  }
}
```

**Transaction Patterns:**
```typescript
// Sequential operations (auto-transaction)
const [user, profile] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.user.create({ data: userData }),
  prisma.profile.create({ data: profileData }),
]);

// Interactive transaction with manual control
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const user = await tx.user.create({ data: userData });

  // Business logic validation
  if (user.email.endsWith('@blocked.com')) {
    throw new Error('Email domain blocked');
  }

  const profile = await tx.profile.create({
    data: { ...profileData, userId: user.id }
  });

  return { user, profile };
}, {
  maxWait: 5000,  // Wait for transaction slot
  timeout: 10000, // Transaction timeout
  isolationLevel: 'Serializable', // Strictest isolation
});

// Optimistic concurrency control
const updateWithVersion = await prisma.post.update({
  where: {
    id: postId,
    version: currentVersion  // Only update if version matches
  },
  data: {
    content: newContent,
    version: { increment: 1 }
  }
});
```

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Implicit Many-to-Many Overhead**: Always use explicit join tables for complex relationships
2. **Over-Including**: Don't include relations you don't need
3. **Ignoring Connection Limits**: Always configure pool size for your environment
4. **Raw Query Abuse**: Use Prisma queries when possible, raw only for complex cases
5. **Migration in Production Dev Mode**: Never use `migrate dev` in production

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
