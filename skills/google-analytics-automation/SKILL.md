# Google Analytics Automation via Rube MCP

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/google-analytics-automation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Google Analytics Automation via Rube MCP Automate Google Analytics 4 (GA4) reporting and property management through Composio's Google Analytics toolkit via Rube MCP.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Common Patterns, Known Pitfalls, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Automate Google Analytics tasks via Rube MCP (Composio): run reports, list accounts/properties, funnels, pivots, key events. Always search tools first for current schemas.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming RUBESEARCHTOOLS responds
2. Call RUBEMANAGECONNECTIONS with toolkit google_analytics
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Google OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows
5. GOOGLEANALYTICSLIST_ACCOUNTS - List all accessible GA4 accounts [Required]
6. GOOGLEANALYTICSLIST_PROPERTIES - List properties under an account [Required]
7. pageSize: Number of results per page

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `google_analytics`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Google OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

#### Imported: Core Workflows

### 1. List Accounts and Properties

**When to use**: User wants to discover available GA4 accounts and properties

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_ACCOUNTS` - List all accessible GA4 accounts [Required]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - List properties under an account [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `pageSize`: Number of results per page
- `pageToken`: Pagination token from previous response
- `filter`: Filter expression for properties (e.g., `parent:accounts/12345`)

**Pitfalls**:
- Property IDs are numeric strings prefixed with 'properties/' (e.g., 'properties/123456')
- Account IDs are prefixed with 'accounts/' (e.g., 'accounts/12345')
- Always list accounts first, then properties under each account
- Pagination required for organizations with many properties

### 2. Run Standard Reports

**When to use**: User wants to query metrics and dimensions from GA4 data

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - Get property ID [Prerequisite]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_GET_METADATA` - Discover available dimensions and metrics [Optional]
3. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CHECK_COMPATIBILITY` - Verify dimension/metric compatibility [Optional]
4. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_REPORT` - Execute the report query [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `property`: Property ID (e.g., 'properties/123456')
- `dateRanges`: Array of date range objects with `startDate` and `endDate`
- `dimensions`: Array of dimension objects with `name` field
- `metrics`: Array of metric objects with `name` field
- `dimensionFilter` / `metricFilter`: Filter expressions
- `orderBys`: Sort order configuration
- `limit`: Maximum rows to return
- `offset`: Row offset for pagination

**Pitfalls**:
- Date format is 'YYYY-MM-DD' or relative values like 'today', 'yesterday', '7daysAgo', '30daysAgo'
- Not all dimensions and metrics are compatible; use CHECK_COMPATIBILITY first
- Use GET_METADATA to discover valid dimension and metric names
- Maximum 9 dimensions per report request
- Row limit defaults vary; set explicitly for large datasets
- `offset` is for result pagination, not date pagination

### 3. Run Batch Reports

**When to use**: User needs multiple different reports from the same property in one call

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - Get property ID [Prerequisite]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_BATCH_RUN_REPORTS` - Execute multiple reports at once [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `property`: Property ID (required)
- `requests`: Array of individual report request objects (same structure as RUN_REPORT)

**Pitfalls**:
- Maximum 5 report requests per batch call
- All reports in a batch must target the same property
- Each individual report has the same dimension/metric limits as RUN_REPORT
- Batch errors may affect all reports; check individual report responses

### 4. Run Pivot Reports

**When to use**: User wants cross-tabulated data (rows vs columns) like pivot tables

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - Get property ID [Prerequisite]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_PIVOT_REPORT` - Execute pivot report [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `property`: Property ID (required)
- `dateRanges`: Date range objects
- `dimensions`: All dimensions used in any pivot
- `metrics`: Metrics to aggregate
- `pivots`: Array of pivot definitions with `fieldNames`, `limit`, and `orderBys`

**Pitfalls**:
- Dimensions used in pivots must also be listed in top-level `dimensions`
- Pivot `fieldNames` reference dimension names from the top-level list
- Complex pivots with many dimensions can produce very large result sets
- Each pivot has its own independent `limit` and `orderBys`

### 5. Run Funnel Reports

**When to use**: User wants to analyze conversion funnels and drop-off rates

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - Get property ID [Prerequisite]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_FUNNEL_REPORT` - Execute funnel analysis [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `property`: Property ID (required)
- `dateRanges`: Date range objects
- `funnel`: Funnel definition with `steps` array
- `funnelBreakdown`: Optional dimension to break down funnel by

**Pitfalls**:
- Funnel steps are ordered; each step defines a condition users must meet
- Steps use filter expressions similar to dimension/metric filters
- Open funnels allow entry at any step; closed funnels require sequential progression
- Funnel reports may take longer to process than standard reports

### 6. Manage Key Events

**When to use**: User wants to view or manage conversion events (key events) in GA4

**Tool sequence**:
1. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES` - Get property ID [Prerequisite]
2. `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_KEY_EVENTS` - List all key events for the property [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `parent`: Property resource name (e.g., 'properties/123456')
- `pageSize`: Number of results per page
- `pageToken`: Pagination token

**Pitfalls**:
- Key events were previously called "conversions" in GA4
- Property must have key events configured to return results
- Key event names correspond to GA4 event names

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Google Analytics connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `google_analytics`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @google-analytics-automation to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @google-analytics-automation against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @google-analytics-automation for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @google-analytics-automation using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/google-analytics-automation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Quick Reference

| Task | Tool Slug | Key Params |
|------|-----------|------------|
| List accounts | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_ACCOUNTS | pageSize, pageToken |
| List properties | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES | filter, pageSize |
| Get metadata | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_GET_METADATA | property |
| Check compatibility | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CHECK_COMPATIBILITY | property, dimensions, metrics |
| Run report | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_REPORT | property, dateRanges, dimensions, metrics |
| Batch reports | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_BATCH_RUN_REPORTS | property, requests |
| Pivot report | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_PIVOT_REPORT | property, dateRanges, pivots |
| Funnel report | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_RUN_FUNNEL_REPORT | property, dateRanges, funnel |
| List key events | GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_KEY_EVENTS | parent, pageSize |

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### ID Resolution

**Account name -> Account ID**:
```
1. Call GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_ACCOUNTS
2. Find account by displayName
3. Extract name field (e.g., 'accounts/12345')
```

**Property name -> Property ID**:
```
1. Call GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LIST_PROPERTIES with filter
2. Find property by displayName
3. Extract name field (e.g., 'properties/123456')
```

### Dimension/Metric Discovery

```
1. Call GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_GET_METADATA with property ID
2. Browse available dimensions and metrics
3. Call GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CHECK_COMPATIBILITY to verify combinations
4. Use verified dimensions/metrics in RUN_REPORT
```

### Pagination

- Reports: Use `offset` and `limit` for row pagination
- Accounts/Properties: Use `pageToken` from response
- Continue until `pageToken` is absent or `rowCount` reached

### Common Dimensions and Metrics

**Dimensions**: `date`, `city`, `country`, `deviceCategory`, `sessionSource`, `sessionMedium`, `pagePath`, `pageTitle`, `eventName`

**Metrics**: `activeUsers`, `sessions`, `screenPageViews`, `eventCount`, `conversions`, `totalRevenue`, `bounceRate`, `averageSessionDuration`

#### Imported: Known Pitfalls

**Property IDs**:
- Always use full resource name format: 'properties/123456'
- Numeric ID alone will cause errors
- Resolve property names to IDs via LIST_PROPERTIES

**Date Ranges**:
- Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' or relative ('today', 'yesterday', '7daysAgo', '30daysAgo')
- Data processing delay means today's data may be incomplete
- Maximum date range varies by property configuration

**Compatibility**:
- Not all dimensions work with all metrics
- Always verify with CHECK_COMPATIBILITY before complex reports
- Custom dimensions/metrics have specific naming patterns

**Response Parsing**:
- Report data is nested in `rows` array with `dimensionValues` and `metricValues`
- Values are returned as strings; parse numbers explicitly
- Empty reports return no `rows` key (not an empty array)

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
