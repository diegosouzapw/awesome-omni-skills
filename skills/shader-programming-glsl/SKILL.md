# Shader Programming GLSL

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/shader-programming-glsl` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Shader Programming GLSL

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when creating custom visual effects in WebGL, Three.js, or game engines.
- Use when optimizing graphics rendering performance.
- Use when implementing post-processing effects (blur, bloom, color correction).
- Use when procedurally generating textures or geometry on the GPU.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Expert guide for writing efficient GLSL shaders (Vertex/Fragment) for web and game engines, covering syntax, uniforms, and common effects.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Vertex Shader: Transforms 3D coordinates to 2D screen space (gl_Position).
2. Fragment Shader: Colors individual pixels (gl_FragColor).
3. uniform: Data constant for all vertices/fragments (passed from CPU).
4. varying: Data interpolated from vertex to fragment shader.
5. color.rgb -> vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.0)
6. color.zyx -> vec3(0.0, 0.5, 1.0) (reordering)
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Structure: Vertex vs. Fragment

Understand the pipeline:
- **Vertex Shader**: Transforms 3D coordinates to 2D screen space (`gl_Position`).
- **Fragment Shader**: Colors individual pixels (`gl_FragColor`).

```glsl
// Vertex Shader (basic)
attribute vec3 position;
uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;

void main() {
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
}
```

```glsl
// Fragment Shader (basic)
uniform vec3 color;

void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

### 2. Uniforms and Varyings

- `uniform`: Data constant for all vertices/fragments (passed from CPU).
- `varying`: Data interpolated from vertex to fragment shader.

```glsl
// Passing UV coordinates
varying vec2 vUv;

// In Vertex Shader
void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
}

// In Fragment Shader
void main() {
    // Gradient based on UV
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vUv.x, vUv.y, 1.0, 1.0);
}
```

### 3. Swizzling & Vector Math

Access vector components freely: `vec4 color = vec4(1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);`
- `color.rgb` -> `vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.0)`
- `color.zyx` -> `vec3(0.0, 0.5, 1.0)` (reordering)

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @shader-programming-glsl to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/shader-programming-glsl/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/shader-programming-glsl/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @shader-programming-glsl using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Simple Raymarching (SDF Sphere)

```glsl
float sdSphere(vec3 p, float s) {
    return length(p) - s;
}

void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) {
    vec2 uv = (fragCoord - 0.5 * iResolution.xy) / iResolution.y;
    vec3 ro = vec3(0.0, 0.0, -3.0); // Ray Origin
    vec3 rd = normalize(vec3(uv, 1.0)); // Ray Direction
    
    float t = 0.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
        vec3 p = ro + rd * t;
        float d = sdSphere(p, 1.0); // Sphere radius 1.0
        if(d < 0.001) break;
        t += d;
    }
    
    vec3 col = vec3(0.0);
    if(t < 10.0) {
        vec3 p = ro + rd * t;
        vec3 normal = normalize(p);
        col = normal * 0.5 + 0.5; // Color by normal
    }
    
    fragColor = vec4(col, 1.0);
}
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ✅ Do: Use mix() for linear interpolation instead of manual math.
- ✅ Do: Use step() and smoothstep() for thresholding and soft edges (avoid if branches).
- ✅ Do: Pack data into vectors (vec4) to minimize memory access.
- ❌ Don't: Use heavy branching (if-else) inside loops if possible; it hurts GPU parallelism.
- ❌ Don't: Calculate constant values inside the shader; pre-calculate them on the CPU (uniforms).
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/shader-programming-glsl`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Shader compiles but screen is black.
**Solution:** Check if `gl_Position.w` is correct (usually 1.0). Check if uniforms are actually being set from the host application. Verify UV coordinates are within [0, 1].
