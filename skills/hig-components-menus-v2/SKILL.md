# Apple HIG: Menus and Buttons

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/hig-components-menus` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Apple HIG: Menus and Buttons Check for .claude/apple-design-context.md before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Output Format, Questions to Ask, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Check for .claude/apple-design-context.md before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Output Format

1. **Component recommendation** -- which menu or button type and why.
2. **Visual hierarchy** -- placement, sizing, grouping within the interface.
3. **Platform-specific behavior** across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS.
4. **Keyboard shortcuts** (macOS) -- standard and custom shortcuts for menu items and toolbar actions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @hig-components-menus-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/hig-components-menus-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/hig-components-menus-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @hig-components-menus-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Menus should be contextual and predictable. Standard items in standard locations. Follow platform conventions for ordering and grouping.
- Use standard button styles. System-defined styles communicate affordance and maintain visual consistency. Prefer them over custom designs.
- Toolbars for frequent actions. Most commonly used commands in the toolbar. Rarely used actions belong in menus.
- Menu bar is the primary command interface on macOS. Every command reachable from the menu bar. Toolbars and context menus supplement, not replace.
- Context menus for secondary actions. Right-click or long-press, relevant to the item under the pointer. Never put a command only in a context menu.
- Pop-up buttons for mutually exclusive choices. Select exactly one option from a set.
- Pull-down buttons for action lists. No current selection; they offer a set of commands.

2. **Use standard button styles.** System-defined styles communicate affordance and maintain visual consistency. Prefer them over custom designs.

3. **Toolbars for frequent actions.** Most commonly used commands in the toolbar. Rarely used actions belong in menus.

4. **Menu bar is the primary command interface on macOS.** Every command reachable from the menu bar. Toolbars and context menus supplement, not replace.

5. **Context menus for secondary actions.** Right-click or long-press, relevant to the item under the pointer. Never put a command only in a context menu.

6. **Pop-up buttons for mutually exclusive choices.** Select exactly one option from a set.

7. **Pull-down buttons for action lists.** No current selection; they offer a set of commands.

8. **Action buttons consolidate related actions** behind a single icon in toolbars or title bars.

9. **Disclosure controls for progressive disclosure.** Show or hide additional content.

10. **Dock menus: short and focused** on the most useful actions when the app is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/hig-components-menus`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
