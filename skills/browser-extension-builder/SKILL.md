# Browser Extension Builder

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/browser-extension-builder` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Browser Extension Builder Expert in building browser extensions that solve real problems - Chrome, Firefox, and cross-browser extensions. Covers extension architecture, manifest v3, content scripts, popup UIs, monetization strategies, and Chrome Web Store publishing. Role: Browser Extension Architect You extend the browser to give users superpowers. You understand the unique constraints of extension development - permissions, security, store policies. You build extensions that people install and actually use daily. You know the difference between a toy and a tool. ### Expertise - Chrome extension APIs - Manifest v3 - Content scripts - Service workers - Extension UX - Store publishing

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Capabilities, Patterns, Extension Architecture, Content Scripts, Storage and State, Extension Monetization.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User mentions or implies: browser extension
- User mentions or implies: chrome extension
- User mentions or implies: firefox addon
- User mentions or implies: extension
- User mentions or implies: manifest v3
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Expert in building browser extensions that solve real problems -.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Capabilities

- Extension architecture
- Manifest v3 (MV3)
- Content scripts
- Background workers
- Popup interfaces
- Extension monetization
- Chrome Web Store publishing
- Cross-browser support

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @browser-extension-builder to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/browser-extension-builder/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/browser-extension-builder/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @browser-extension-builder using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/browser-extension-builder`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Manifest V3 Template
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What it does",
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab"],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup/popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
    "js": ["content/content.js"]
  }],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background/service-worker.js"
  },
  "options_page": "options/options.html"
}
```

### Communication Pattern
```
Popup ←→ Background (Service Worker) ←→ Content Script
              ↓
        chrome.storage
```

### Content Scripts

Code that runs on web pages

**When to use**: When modifying or reading page content

#### Imported: Content Scripts

### Basic Content Script
```javascript
// content.js - Runs on every matched page

// Wait for page to load
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Modify the page
  const element = document.querySelector('.target');
  if (element) {
    element.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
});

// Listen for messages from popup/background
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.action === 'getData') {
    const data = document.querySelector('.data')?.textContent;
    sendResponse({ data });
  }
  return true; // Keep channel open for async
});
```

### Injecting UI
```javascript
// Create floating UI on page
function injectUI() {
  const container = document.createElement('div');
  container.id = 'my-extension-ui';
  container.innerHTML = `
    <div style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px;
                background: white; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px;
                box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15); z-index: 10000;">
      <h3>My Extension</h3>
      <button id="my-extension-btn">Click me</button>
    </div>
  `;
  document.body.appendChild(container);

  document.getElementById('my-extension-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Handle click
  });
}

injectUI();
```

### Permissions for Content Scripts
```json
{
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": ["https://specific-site.com/*"],
    "js": ["content.js"],
    "run_at": "document_end"
  }]
}
```

### Storage and State

Persisting extension data

**When to use**: When saving user settings or data

#### Imported: Storage and State

### Chrome Storage API
```javascript
// Save data
chrome.storage.local.set({ key: 'value' }, () => {
  console.log('Saved');
});

// Get data
chrome.storage.local.get(['key'], (result) => {
  console.log(result.key);
});

// Sync storage (syncs across devices)
chrome.storage.sync.set({ setting: true });

// Watch for changes
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, area) => {
  if (changes.key) {
    console.log('key changed:', changes.key.newValue);
  }
});
```

### Storage Limits
| Type | Limit |
|------|-------|
| local | 5MB |
| sync | 100KB total, 8KB per item |

### Async/Await Pattern
```javascript
// Modern async wrapper
async function getStorage(keys) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    chrome.storage.local.get(keys, resolve);
  });
}

async function setStorage(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    chrome.storage.local.set(data, resolve);
  });
}

// Usage
const { settings } = await getStorage(['settings']);
await setStorage({ settings: { ...settings, theme: 'dark' } });
```

### Extension Monetization

Making money from extensions

**When to use**: When planning extension revenue

#### Imported: Extension Monetization

### Revenue Models
| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| Freemium | Free basic, paid features |
| One-time | Pay once, use forever |
| Subscription | Monthly/yearly access |
| Donations | Tip jar / Buy me a coffee |
| Affiliate | Recommend products |

### Payment Integration
```javascript
// Use your backend for payments
// Extension can't directly use Stripe

// 1. User clicks "Upgrade" in popup
// 2. Open your website with user ID
chrome.tabs.create({
  url: `https://your-site.com/upgrade?user=${userId}`
});

// 3. After payment, sync status
async function checkPremium() {
  const { userId } = await getStorage(['userId']);
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://your-api.com/premium/${userId}`
  );
  const { isPremium } = await response.json();
  await setStorage({ isPremium });
  return isPremium;
}
```

### Feature Gating
```javascript
async function usePremiumFeature() {
  const { isPremium } = await getStorage(['isPremium']);
  if (!isPremium) {
    showUpgradeModal();
    return;
  }
  // Run premium feature
}
```

### Chrome Web Store Payments
- Chrome discontinued built-in payments
- Use your own payment system
- Link to external checkout page

#### Imported: Validation Checks

### Using Deprecated Manifest V2

Severity: HIGH

Message: Using Manifest V2 - Chrome requires V3 for new extensions.

Fix action: Migrate to Manifest V3 with service worker

### Excessive Permissions Requested

Severity: HIGH

Message: Requesting broad permissions - may cause store rejection.

Fix action: Use specific host_permissions and optional_permissions

### No Error Handling in Extension

Severity: MEDIUM

Message: Not checking chrome.runtime.lastError for errors.

Fix action: Check chrome.runtime.lastError after API calls

### Hardcoded URLs in Extension

Severity: MEDIUM

Message: Hardcoded URLs may cause issues in production.

Fix action: Use chrome.storage or manifest for configuration

### Missing Extension Icons

Severity: LOW

Message: Missing extension icons - affects store listing.

Fix action: Add icons in 16, 48, and 128 pixel sizes
