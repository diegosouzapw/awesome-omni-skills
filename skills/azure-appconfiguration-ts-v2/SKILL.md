# Azure App Configuration SDK for TypeScript

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-appconfiguration-ts` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Azure App Configuration SDK for TypeScript Centralized configuration management with feature flags and dynamic refresh.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Environment Variables, Authentication, CRUD Operations, App Configuration Provider, Feature Flags, Snapshots.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Centralized configuration management with feature flags and dynamic refresh.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. bash # Low-level CRUD SDK npm install @azure/app-configuration @azure/identity # High-level provider (recommended for apps) npm install @azure/app-configuration-provider @azure/identity # Feature flag management npm install @microsoft/feature-management
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```bash
# Low-level CRUD SDK
npm install @azure/app-configuration @azure/identity

# High-level provider (recommended for apps)
npm install @azure/app-configuration-provider @azure/identity

# Feature flag management
npm install @microsoft/feature-management
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```bash
AZURE_APPCONFIG_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.azconfig.io
# OR
AZURE_APPCONFIG_CONNECTION_STRING=Endpoint=https://...;Id=...;Secret=...
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-appconfiguration-ts-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @azure-appconfiguration-ts-v2 against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @azure-appconfiguration-ts-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-appconfiguration-ts-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Use provider for apps - @azure/app-configuration-provider for runtime config
- Use low-level for management - @azure/app-configuration for CRUD operations
- Enable refresh - For dynamic configuration updates
- Use labels - Separate configurations by environment
- Use snapshots - For immutable release configurations
- Sentinel pattern - Use a sentinel key to trigger full refresh
- RBAC roles - App Configuration Data Reader for read-only access

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-appconfiguration-ts`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

for await (const setting of settings) {
  console.log(`${setting.key}: ${setting.value}`);
}
```

### Delete Settings

await client.deleteConfigurationSetting({
  key: "app:settings:message",
  label: "production",
});
```

### Lock/Unlock (Read-Only)

await client.setReadOnly({ key: "myKey", label: "prod" }, true);

// Unlock
await client.setReadOnly({ key: "myKey", label: "prod" }, false);
```

#### Imported: App Configuration Provider

### Load Configuration

```typescript
import { load } from "@azure/app-configuration-provider";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

const appConfig = await load(
  process.env.AZURE_APPCONFIG_ENDPOINT!,
  new DefaultAzureCredential(),
  {
    selectors: [
      { keyFilter: "app:*", labelFilter: "production" },
    ],
    trimKeyPrefixes: ["app:"],
  }
);

// Map-style access
const value = appConfig.get("settings:message");

// Object-style access
const config = appConfig.constructConfigurationObject({ separator: ":" });
console.log(config.settings.message);
```

const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
  selectors: [{ keyFilter: "app:*" }],
  refreshOptions: {
    enabled: true,
    refreshIntervalInMs: 30_000,  // 30 seconds
  },
});

// Trigger refresh (non-blocking)
appConfig.refresh();

// Listen for refresh events
const disposer = appConfig.onRefresh(() => {
  console.log("Configuration refreshed!");
});

// Express middleware pattern
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  appConfig.refresh();
  next();
});
```

  },
});

// Secrets are automatically resolved
const dbPassword = appConfig.get("database:password");
```

#### Imported: Feature Flags

### Create Feature Flag (Low-Level)

```typescript
import {
  featureFlagPrefix,
  featureFlagContentType,
  FeatureFlagValue,
  ConfigurationSetting,
} from "@azure/app-configuration";

const flag: ConfigurationSetting<FeatureFlagValue> = {
  key: `${featureFlagPrefix}Beta`,
  contentType: featureFlagContentType,
  value: {
    id: "Beta",
    enabled: true,
    description: "Beta feature",
    conditions: {
      clientFilters: [
        {
          name: "Microsoft.Targeting",
          parameters: {
            Audience: {
              Users: ["user@example.com"],
              Groups: [{ Name: "beta-testers", RolloutPercentage: 50 }],
              DefaultRolloutPercentage: 0,
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

await client.addConfigurationSetting(flag);
```

### Load and Evaluate Feature Flags

```typescript
import { load } from "@azure/app-configuration-provider";
import {
  ConfigurationMapFeatureFlagProvider,
  FeatureManager,
} from "@microsoft/feature-management";

const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
  featureFlagOptions: {
    enabled: true,
    selectors: [{ keyFilter: "*" }],
    refresh: {
      enabled: true,
      refreshIntervalInMs: 30_000,
    },
  },
});

const featureProvider = new ConfigurationMapFeatureFlagProvider(appConfig);
const featureManager = new FeatureManager(featureProvider);

// Simple check
const isEnabled = await featureManager.isEnabled("Beta");

// With targeting context
const isEnabledForUser = await featureManager.isEnabled("Beta", {
  userId: "user@example.com",
  groups: ["beta-testers"],
});
```

#### Imported: Snapshots

```typescript
// Create snapshot
const snapshot = await client.beginCreateSnapshotAndWait({
  name: "release-v1.0",
  retentionPeriod: 2592000,  // 30 days
  filters: [{ keyFilter: "app:*", labelFilter: "production" }],
});

// Get snapshot
const snap = await client.getSnapshot("release-v1.0");

// List settings in snapshot
const settings = client.listConfigurationSettingsForSnapshot("release-v1.0");
for await (const setting of settings) {
  console.log(`${setting.key}: ${setting.value}`);
}

// Archive/recover
await client.archiveSnapshot("release-v1.0");
await client.recoverSnapshot("release-v1.0");

// Load from snapshot (provider)
const config = await load(endpoint, credential, {
  selectors: [{ snapshotName: "release-v1.0" }],
});
```

#### Imported: Labels

```typescript
// Create settings with labels
await client.setConfigurationSetting({
  key: "database:host",
  value: "dev-db.example.com",
  label: "development",
});

await client.setConfigurationSetting({
  key: "database:host",
  value: "prod-db.example.com",
  label: "production",
});

// Filter by label
const prodSettings = client.listConfigurationSettings({
  keyFilter: "*",
  labelFilter: "production",
});

// No label (null label)
const noLabelSettings = client.listConfigurationSettings({
  labelFilter: "\0",
});

// List available labels
for await (const label of client.listLabels()) {
  console.log(label.name);
}
```

#### Imported: Key Types
