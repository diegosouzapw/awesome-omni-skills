# Rayden Code Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/rayden-code` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Rayden Code Skill

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Security & Safety Notes, Common Pitfalls, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You're building a new page or feature using Rayden UI components
- You want to scaffold a dashboard, landing page, auth screen, settings page, or data table
- You need to generate React code that follows a specific design system precisely
- You want to prototype UI quickly with correct component usage and premium aesthetics
- You're vibe coding and want design-system-compliant output
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generate React code with Rayden UI components using correct props, tokens, and premium layout patterns.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Generate production-quality React + Tailwind CSS code using the Rayden UI component library (34 components). The skill loads a complete API reference with every component, every prop, design tokens, layout patterns, and an explicit anti-pattern ban list — preventing hallucinated components and generic AI output. Built on the Rayna UI design system.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Parses the request** — Identifies page type, required components, and data model
2. **Loads RAYDEN_RULES.md** — Complete reference: 34 components with full props, design philosophy, token classes, layout patterns, anti-patterns, and accessibility rules
3. **Plans the layout** — Decides page structure, component selection, spacing, color, and elevation strategy
4. **Generates code** — Writes React + Tailwind CSS using only documented components and token classes
5. **Self-validates** — Runs a 16-point checklist covering correctness (valid components/props, token usage, nesting) and design quality (whitespace, hierarchy, restraint, responsiveness)

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @rayden-code to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/rayden-code/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/rayden-code/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @rayden-code using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Vibe code a SaaS dashboard

```
/rayden-code a dashboard with KPI cards, a recent orders table, and an activity feed
```

**Use case:** You're building an internal analytics tool and need a full dashboard page with MetricsCard grid, sortable Table, and ActivityFeed sidebar — all with correct Rayden imports and token classes.

### Scaffold a login page

```
/rayden-code login page with email and password
```

**Use case:** You need a centered auth form with Input components, a primary Button, and proper visual hierarchy — following Rayden's "Auth / Focused Form" pattern.

### Build an admin settings page

```
/rayden-code settings page with profile section, notification toggles, and danger zone
```

**Use case:** You're adding a settings area to your app and need form sections with Toggle components, a destructive action zone, and a single-column constrained layout.

### Create a pricing page

```
/rayden-code pricing page with 3 tiers and a feature comparison table
```

**Use case:** You need a marketing pricing section with Card components for each tier, Badge for the recommended plan, and a Table for feature comparison.

### Build an e-commerce product grid

```
/rayden-code product catalog with filters, search, and a card grid
```

**Use case:** You're building a storefront and need a responsive product grid with Chip filters, Input search, Pagination, and Cards with images — all using Rayden's layout and spacing rules.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Describe what you want in plain language — the skill maps your request to the right components
- Install @raydenui/ui in your project first (npm install @raydenui/ui)
- Import @raydenui/ui/styles.css in your app entry point for design tokens to work
- Review generated code for business logic — the skill handles UI, not data fetching
- Use alongside /rayden-use if you also want the same design built in Figma
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

- Install `@raydenui/ui` in your project first (`npm install @raydenui/ui`)
- Import `@raydenui/ui/styles.css` in your app entry point for design tokens to work

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/rayden-code`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Security & Safety Notes

- This skill only reads its bundled rules file and writes code to your project
- No external network requests
- No secrets or credentials involved
- Generated code uses standard React patterns with no eval or dynamic code execution

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Components not rendering correctly | Ensure `@raydenui/ui/styles.css` is imported in your app entry |
| "Component doesn't exist" error | The skill only uses documented components — check if you're asking for something Rayden doesn't have |
| Colors look wrong | Use token classes (`bg-primary-500`) not hex values. Ensure the Rayden CSS is loaded |
| Layout not responsive | The skill generates responsive code by default — check that your viewport meta tag is set |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
