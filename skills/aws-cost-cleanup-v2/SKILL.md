# AWS Cost Cleanup

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/aws-cost-cleanup` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# AWS Cost Cleanup Automate the identification and removal of unused AWS resources to eliminate waste.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Automated Cleanup Targets, Cleanup Scripts, Cost Impact Calculator, Automated Cleanup Lambda, Safety Checklist, Integration with AWS Organizations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use this skill when you need to automatically clean up unused AWS resources to reduce costs and eliminate waste.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Automated cleanup of unused AWS resources to reduce costs.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Discovery Phase (Read-only)
2. Run all describe commands
3. Generate cost impact report
4. Review with team
5. Validation Phase
6. Verify resources are truly unused
7. Check for dependencies

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Cleanup Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase** (Read-only)
   - Run all describe commands
   - Generate cost impact report
   - Review with team

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify resources are truly unused
   - Check for dependencies
   - Notify resource owners

3. **Execution Phase** (Dry-run first)
   - Run cleanup scripts with dry-run
   - Review proposed changes
   - Execute actual cleanup

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Confirm deletions
   - Monitor for issues
   - Document savings

#### Imported: Automated Cleanup Targets

**Storage**
- Unattached EBS volumes
- Old EBS snapshots (>90 days)
- Incomplete multipart S3 uploads
- Old S3 versions in versioned buckets

**Compute**
- Stopped EC2 instances (>30 days)
- Unused AMIs and associated snapshots
- Unused Elastic IPs

**Networking**
- Unused Elastic Load Balancers
- Unused NAT Gateways
- Orphaned ENIs

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @aws-cost-cleanup-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @aws-cost-cleanup-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @aws-cost-cleanup-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @aws-cost-cleanup-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Example Prompts

**Discovery**
- "Find all unused resources and calculate potential savings"
- "Generate a cleanup report for my AWS account"
- "What resources can I safely delete?"

**Execution**
- "Create a script to cleanup unattached EBS volumes"
- "Delete all snapshots older than 90 days"
- "Release unused Elastic IPs"

**Automation**
- "Set up automated cleanup for old snapshots"
- "Create a Lambda function for weekly cleanup"
- "Schedule monthly resource cleanup"

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Schedule cleanup during maintenance windows
- Always create final snapshots before deletion
- Use resource tags to identify cleanup candidates
- Implement approval workflow for production
- Log all cleanup actions for audit
- Set up cost anomaly detection
- Review cleanup results weekly

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/aws-cost-cleanup`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

#### Imported: Risk Mitigation

**Medium Risk Actions:**
- Deleting unattached volumes (ensure no planned reattachment)
- Removing old snapshots (verify no compliance requirements)
- Releasing Elastic IPs (check DNS records)

**Always:**
- Maintain 30-day backup retention
- Use AWS Backup for critical resources
- Test restore procedures
- Document cleanup decisions
