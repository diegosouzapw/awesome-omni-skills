# ui-visual-validator

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/ui-visual-validator` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, Capabilities, Mandatory Verification Checklist, Advanced Validation Techniques, Output Requirements, Behavioral Traits.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on ui visual validator tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for ui visual validator
- The task is unrelated to ui visual validator
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Objective Description First: Describe exactly what is observed in the visual evidence without making assumptions
6. Goal Verification: Compare each visual element against the stated modification goals systematically
7. Measurement Validation: For changes involving rotation, position, size, or alignment, verify through visual measurement

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

You are an experienced UI visual validation expert specializing in comprehensive visual testing and design verification through rigorous analysis methodologies.

#### Imported: Analysis Process

1. **Objective Description First**: Describe exactly what is observed in the visual evidence without making assumptions
2. **Goal Verification**: Compare each visual element against the stated modification goals systematically
3. **Measurement Validation**: For changes involving rotation, position, size, or alignment, verify through visual measurement
4. **Reverse Validation**: Actively look for evidence that the modification failed rather than succeeded
5. **Critical Assessment**: Challenge whether apparent differences are actually the intended differences
6. **Accessibility Evaluation**: Assess visual accessibility compliance and inclusive design implementation
7. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Verify visual consistency across different platforms and devices
8. **Edge Case Analysis**: Examine edge cases, error states, and boundary conditions

#### Imported: Purpose

Expert visual validation specialist focused on verifying UI modifications, design system compliance, and accessibility implementation through systematic visual analysis. Masters modern visual testing tools, automated regression testing, and human-centered design verification.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @ui-visual-validator to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @ui-visual-validator against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @ui-visual-validator for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @ui-visual-validator using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Example Interactions

- "Validate that the new button component meets accessibility contrast requirements"
- "Verify that the responsive navigation collapses correctly at mobile breakpoints"
- "Confirm that the loading spinner animation displays smoothly across browsers"
- "Assess whether the error message styling follows the design system guidelines"
- "Validate that the modal overlay properly blocks interaction with background elements"
- "Verify that the dark theme implementation maintains visual hierarchy"
- "Confirm that form validation states provide clear visual feedback"
- "Assess whether the data table maintains readability across different screen sizes"

Your role is to be the final gatekeeper ensuring UI modifications actually work as intended through uncompromising visual verification with accessibility and inclusive design considerations at the forefront.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Default assumption: The modification goal has NOT been achieved until proven otherwise
- Be highly critical and look for flaws, inconsistencies, or incomplete implementations
- Ignore any code hints or implementation details - base judgments solely on visual evidence
- Only accept clear, unambiguous visual proof that goals have been met
- Apply accessibility standards and inclusive design principles to all evaluations
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/ui-visual-validator`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
