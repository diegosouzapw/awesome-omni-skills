# Copy Editing

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/copy-editing` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Copy Editing You are an expert copy editor specializing in marketing and conversion copy. Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Philosophy, The Seven Sweeps Framework, Quick-Pass Editing Checks, Copy Editing Checklist, Working with Copy Sweeps, Questions to Ask.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Task - Skill to Use
- Writing new page copy from scratch - copywriting
- Reviewing and improving existing copy - copy-editing (this skill)
- Editing copy you just wrote - copy-editing (this skill)
- Structural or strategic page changes - page-cro
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: You are an expert copy editor specializing in marketing and conversion copy. Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Philosophy

Good copy editing isn't about rewriting—it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.

**Key principles:**
- Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it
- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review
- Each edit should have a clear reason
- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @copy-editing to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/copy-editing/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/copy-editing/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @copy-editing using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/copy-editing`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Common Copy Problems & Fixes

### Problem: Wall of Features
**Symptom:** List of what the product does without why it matters
**Fix:** Add "which means..." after each feature to bridge to benefits

### Problem: Corporate Speak
**Symptom:** "Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes"
**Fix:** Ask "How would a human say this?" and use those words

### Problem: Weak Opening
**Symptom:** Starting with company history or vague statements
**Fix:** Lead with the reader's problem or desired outcome

### Problem: Buried CTA
**Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn't clear
**Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated

### Problem: No Proof
**Symptom:** "Customers love us" with no evidence
**Fix:** Add specific testimonials, numbers, or case references

### Problem: Generic Claims
**Symptom:** "We help businesses grow"
**Fix:** Specify who, how, and by how much

### Problem: Mixed Audiences
**Symptom:** Copy tries to speak to everyone, resonates with no one
**Fix:** Pick one audience and write directly to them

### Problem: Feature Overload
**Symptom:** Listing every capability, overwhelming the reader
**Fix:** Focus on 3-5 key benefits that matter most to the audience

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: The Seven Sweeps Framework

Edit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren't compromised.

### Sweep 1: Clarity

**Focus:** Can the reader understand what you're saying?

**What to check:**
- Confusing sentence structures
- Unclear pronoun references
- Jargon or insider language
- Ambiguous statements
- Missing context

**Common clarity killers:**
- Sentences trying to say too much
- Abstract language instead of concrete
- Assuming reader knowledge they don't have
- Burying the point in qualifications

**Process:**
1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts
2. Don't correct yet—just note problem areas
3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits
4. Verify edits maintain the original intent

**After this sweep:** Confirm the "Rule of One" (one main idea per section) and "You Rule" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.

---

### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone

**Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds?

**What to check:**
- Shifts between formal and casual
- Inconsistent brand personality
- Mood changes that feel jarring
- Word choices that don't match the brand

**Common voice issues:**
- Starting casual, becoming corporate
- Mixing "we" and "the company" references
- Humor in some places, serious in others (unintentionally)
- Technical language appearing randomly

**Process:**
1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies
2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly
3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions
4. Ensure personality remains throughout

**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion.

---

### Sweep 3: So What

**Focus:** Does every claim answer "why should I care?"

**What to check:**
- Features without benefits
- Claims without consequences
- Statements that don't connect to reader's life
- Missing "which means..." bridges

**The So What test:**
For every statement, ask "Okay, so what?" If the copy doesn't answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work.

❌ "Our platform uses AI-powered analytics"
*So what?*
✅ "Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually—so you can make better decisions in half the time"

**Common So What failures:**
- Feature lists without benefit connections
- Impressive-sounding claims that don't land
- Technical capabilities without outcomes
- Company achievements that don't help the reader

**Process:**
1. Read each claim and literally ask "so what?"
2. Highlight claims missing the answer
3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning
4. Ensure benefits connect to real reader desires

**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 4: Prove It

**Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence?

**What to check:**
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Missing social proof
- Assertions without backup
- "Best" or "leading" without evidence

**Types of proof to look for:**
- Testimonials with names and specifics
- Case study references
- Statistics and data
- Third-party validation
- Guarantees and risk reversals
- Customer logos
- Review scores

**Common proof gaps:**
- "Trusted by thousands" (which thousands?)
- "Industry-leading" (according to whom?)
- "Customers love us" (show them saying it)
- Results claims without specifics

**Process:**
1. Identify every claim that needs proof
2. Check if proof exists nearby
3. Flag unsupported assertions
4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims

**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 5: Specificity

**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?

**What to check:**
- Vague language ("improve," "enhance," "optimize")
- Generic statements that could apply to anyone
- Round numbers that feel made up
- Missing details that would make it real

**Specificity upgrades:**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Save time | Save 4 hours every week |
| Many customers | 2,847 teams |
| Fast results | Results in 14 days |
| Improve your workflow | Cut your reporting time in half |
| Great support | Response within 2 hours |

**Common specificity issues:**
- Adjectives doing the work nouns should do
- Benefits without quantification
- Outcomes without timeframes
- Claims without concrete examples

**Process:**
1. Highlight vague words and phrases
2. Ask "Can this be more specific?"
3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples
4. Remove content that can't be made specific (it's probably filler)

**After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion

**Focus:** Does the copy make the reader feel something?

**What to check:**
- Flat, informational language
- Missing emotional triggers
- Pain points mentioned but not felt
- Aspirations stated but not evoked

**Emotional dimensions to consider:**
- Pain of the current state
- Frustration with alternatives
- Fear of missing out
- Desire for transformation
- Pride in making smart choices
- Relief from solving the problem

**Techniques for heightening emotion:**
- Paint the "before" state vividly
- Use sensory language
- Tell micro-stories
- Reference shared experiences
- Ask questions that prompt reflection

**Process:**
1. Read for emotional impact—does it move you?
2. Identify flat sections that should resonate
3. Add emotional texture while staying authentic
4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation)

**After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 7: Zero Risk

**Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to action?

**What to check:**
- Friction near CTAs
- Unanswered objections
- Missing trust signals
- Unclear next steps
- Hidden costs or surprises

**Risk reducers to look for:**
- Money-back guarantees
- Free trials
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- Social proof near CTA
- Clear expectations of what happens next
- Privacy assurances

**Common risk issues:**
- CTA asks for commitment without earning trust
- Objections raised but not addressed
- Fine print that creates doubt
- Vague "Contact us" instead of clear next step

**Process:**
1. Focus on sections near CTAs
2. List every reason someone might hesitate
3. Check if the copy addresses each concern
4. Add risk reversals or trust signals as needed

**After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time: Heightened Emotion, Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, Clarity.

#### Imported: Quick-Pass Editing Checks

Use these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn't needed.

### Word-Level Checks

**Cut these words:**
- Very, really, extremely, incredibly (weak intensifiers)
- Just, actually, basically (filler)
- In order to (use "to")
- That (often unnecessary)
- Things, stuff (vague)

**Replace these:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Implement | Set up |
| Leverage | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Innovative | New |
| Robust | Strong |
| Seamless | Smooth |
| Cutting-edge | New/Modern |

**Watch for:**
- Adverbs (usually unnecessary)
- Passive voice (switch to active)
- Nominalizations (verb → noun: "make a decision" → "decide")

### Sentence-Level Checks

- One idea per sentence
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Front-load important information
- Max 3 conjunctions per sentence
- No more than 25 words (usually)

### Paragraph-Level Checks

- One topic per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences for web)
- Strong opening sentences
- Logical flow between paragraphs
- White space for scannability

#### Imported: Working with Copy Sweeps

When editing collaboratively:

1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it's an issue
2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don't just identify problems; propose solutions
3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions
4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps
5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues

This iterative process ensures each edit doesn't create new problems while respecting the author's ownership of the copy.

---

#### Imported: Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What's the goal of this copy? (Awareness, conversion, retention)
2. Who's the target audience?
3. What action should readers take?
4. What's the brand voice? (Casual, professional, playful, authoritative)
5. Are there specific concerns or known issues?
6. What proof/evidence do you have available?
