# Testing Patterns and Utilities

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/testing-patterns` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Testing Patterns and Utilities

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Testing Philosophy, Test Utilities, Factory Pattern, Mocking Patterns, Test Structure, Query Patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Jest testing patterns, factory functions, mocking strategies, and TDD workflow. Use when writing unit tests, creating test factories, or following TDD red-green-refactor cycle.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Testing Philosophy

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- Write failing test FIRST
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor after green
- Never write production code without a failing test

**Behavior-Driven Testing:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Focus on public APIs and business requirements
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Use descriptive test names that describe behavior

**Factory Pattern:**
- Create `getMockX(overrides?: Partial<X>)` functions
- Provide sensible defaults
- Allow overriding specific properties
- Keep tests DRY and maintainable

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @testing-patterns-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/testing-patterns-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/testing-patterns-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @testing-patterns-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always use factory functions for props and data
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use descriptive test names
- Organize with describe blocks
- Clear mocks between tests
- Keep tests focused - one behavior per test
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/testing-patterns`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Test Utilities

### Custom Render Function

Create a custom render that wraps components with required providers:

```typescript
// src/utils/testUtils.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { ThemeProvider } from './theme';

export const renderWithTheme = (ui: React.ReactElement) => {
  return render(
    <ThemeProvider>{ui}</ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { renderWithTheme } from 'utils/testUtils';
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react-native';

it('should render component', () => {
  renderWithTheme(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

#### Imported: Factory Pattern

### Component Props Factory

```typescript
import { ComponentProps } from 'react';

const getMockMyComponentProps = (
  overrides?: Partial<ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent>>
) => {
  return {
    title: 'Default Title',
    count: 0,
    onPress: jest.fn(),
    isLoading: false,
    ...overrides,
  };
};

// Usage in tests
it('should render with custom title', () => {
  const props = getMockMyComponentProps({ title: 'Custom Title' });
  renderWithTheme(<MyComponent {...props} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Custom Title')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Data Factory

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}

const getMockUser = (overrides?: Partial<User>): User => {
  return {
    id: '123',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    role: 'user',
    ...overrides,
  };
};

// Usage
it('should display admin badge for admin users', () => {
  const user = getMockUser({ role: 'admin' });
  renderWithTheme(<UserCard user={user} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Admin')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

#### Imported: Mocking Patterns

### Mocking Modules

```typescript
// Mock entire module
jest.mock('utils/analytics');

// Mock with factory function
jest.mock('utils/analytics', () => ({
  Analytics: {
    logEvent: jest.fn(),
  },
}));

// Access mock in test
const mockLogEvent = jest.requireMock('utils/analytics').Analytics.logEvent;
```

### Mocking GraphQL Hooks

```typescript
jest.mock('./GetItems.generated', () => ({
  useGetItemsQuery: jest.fn(),
}));

const mockUseGetItemsQuery = jest.requireMock(
  './GetItems.generated'
).useGetItemsQuery as jest.Mock;

// In test
mockUseGetItemsQuery.mockReturnValue({
  data: { items: [] },
  loading: false,
  error: undefined,
});
```

#### Imported: Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('Rendering', () => {
    it('should render component with default props', () => {});
    it('should render loading state when loading', () => {});
  });

  describe('User interactions', () => {
    it('should call onPress when button is clicked', async () => {});
  });

  describe('Edge cases', () => {
    it('should handle empty data gracefully', () => {});
  });
});
```

#### Imported: Query Patterns

```typescript
// Element must exist
expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeTruthy();

// Element should not exist
expect(screen.queryByText('Goodbye')).toBeNull();

// Element appears asynchronously
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.findByText('Loaded')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

#### Imported: User Interaction Patterns

```typescript
import { fireEvent, screen } from '@testing-library/react-native';

it('should submit form on button click', async () => {
  const onSubmit = jest.fn();
  renderWithTheme(<LoginForm onSubmit={onSubmit} />);

  fireEvent.changeText(screen.getByLabelText('Email'), 'user@example.com');
  fireEvent.changeText(screen.getByLabelText('Password'), 'password123');
  fireEvent.press(screen.getByTestId('login-button'));

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

#### Imported: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Testing Mock Behavior Instead of Real Behavior

```typescript
// Bad - testing the mock
expect(mockFetchData).toHaveBeenCalled();

// Good - testing actual behavior
expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeTruthy();
```

### Not Using Factories

```typescript
// Bad - duplicated, inconsistent test data
it('test 1', () => {
  const user = { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@test.com', role: 'user' };
});
it('test 2', () => {
  const user = { id: '2', name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@test.com' }; // Missing role!
});

// Good - reusable factory
const user = getMockUser({ name: 'Custom Name' });
```

#### Imported: Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific file
npm test ComponentName.test.tsx
```
