# Azure AI Voice Live SDK

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-ai-voicelive-py` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Azure AI Voice Live SDK Build real-time voice AI applications with bidirectional WebSocket communication.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Environment Variables, Authentication, Core Architecture, Session Configuration, Audio Streaming, Event Handling.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Build real-time voice AI applications with bidirectional WebSocket communication.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. bash pip install azure-ai-voicelive aiohttp azure-identity
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```bash
pip install azure-ai-voicelive aiohttp azure-identity
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```bash
AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_ENDPOINT=https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
# For API key auth (not recommended for production)
AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_KEY=<api-key>
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-ai-voicelive-py to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @azure-ai-voicelive-py against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @azure-ai-voicelive-py for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-ai-voicelive-py using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
import os
from azure.ai.voicelive.aio import connect
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

async def main():
    async with connect(
        endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_ENDPOINT"],
        credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
        model="gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
        credential_scopes=["https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"]
    ) as conn:
        # Update session with instructions
        await conn.session.update(session={
            "instructions": "You are a helpful assistant.",
            "modalities": ["text", "audio"],
            "voice": "alloy"
        })
        
        # Listen for events
        async for event in conn:
            print(f"Event: {event.type}")
            if event.type == "response.audio_transcript.done":
                print(f"Transcript: {event.transcript}")
            elif event.type == "response.done":
                break

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/azure-ai-voicelive-py`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

))
```

#### Imported: Audio Streaming

### Send Audio (Base64 PCM16)

```python
import base64

# Read audio chunk (16-bit PCM, 24kHz mono)
audio_chunk = await read_audio_from_microphone()
b64_audio = base64.b64encode(audio_chunk).decode()

await conn.input_audio_buffer.append(audio=b64_audio)
```

### Receive Audio

```python
async for event in conn:
    if event.type == "response.audio.delta":
        audio_bytes = base64.b64decode(event.delta)
        await play_audio(audio_bytes)
    elif event.type == "response.audio.done":
        print("Audio complete")
```

#### Imported: Event Handling

```python
async for event in conn:
    match event.type:
        # Session events
        case "session.created":
            print(f"Session: {event.session}")
        case "session.updated":
            print("Session updated")
        
        # Audio input events
        case "input_audio_buffer.speech_started":
            print(f"Speech started at {event.audio_start_ms}ms")
        case "input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped":
            print(f"Speech stopped at {event.audio_end_ms}ms")
        
        # Transcription events
        case "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed":
            print(f"User said: {event.transcript}")
        case "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta":
            print(f"Partial: {event.delta}")
        
        # Response events
        case "response.created":
            print(f"Response started: {event.response.id}")
        case "response.audio_transcript.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)
        case "response.audio.delta":
            audio = base64.b64decode(event.delta)
        case "response.done":
            print(f"Response complete: {event.response.status}")
        
        # Function calls
        case "response.function_call_arguments.done":
            result = handle_function(event.name, event.arguments)
            await conn.conversation.item.create(item={
                "type": "function_call_output",
                "call_id": event.call_id,
                "output": json.dumps(result)
            })
            await conn.response.create()
        
        # Errors
        case "error":
            print(f"Error: {event.error.message}")
```

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### Manual Turn Mode (No VAD)

```python
await conn.session.update(session={"turn_detection": None})

# Manually control turns
await conn.input_audio_buffer.append(audio=b64_audio)
await conn.input_audio_buffer.commit()  # End of user turn
await conn.response.create()  # Trigger response
```

### Interrupt Handling

```python
async for event in conn:
    if event.type == "input_audio_buffer.speech_started":
        # User interrupted - cancel current response
        await conn.response.cancel()
        await conn.output_audio_buffer.clear()
```

### Conversation History

```python
# Add system message
await conn.conversation.item.create(item={
    "type": "message",
    "role": "system",
    "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Be concise."}]
})

# Add user message
await conn.conversation.item.create(item={
    "type": "message",
    "role": "user", 
    "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Hello!"}]
})

await conn.response.create()
```
