# Podcast Generation with GPT Realtime Mini

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/podcast-generation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Podcast Generation with GPT Realtime Mini Generate real audio narratives from text content using Azure OpenAI's Realtime API.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Environment Configuration, Voice Options, Realtime API Events, Audio Format, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generate real audio narratives from text content using Azure OpenAI's Realtime API.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

3. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
4. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
5. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
6. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
7. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Workflow

### Backend Audio Generation

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import base64

# Convert HTTPS endpoint to WebSocket URL
ws_url = endpoint.replace("https://", "wss://") + "/openai/v1"

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    websocket_base_url=ws_url,
    api_key=api_key
)

audio_chunks = []
transcript_parts = []

async with client.realtime.connect(model="gpt-realtime-mini") as conn:
    # Configure for audio-only output
    await conn.session.update(session={
        "output_modalities": ["audio"],
        "instructions": "You are a narrator. Speak naturally."
    })
    
    # Send text to narrate
    await conn.conversation.item.create(item={
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": prompt}]
    })
    
    await conn.response.create()
    
    # Collect streaming events
    async for event in conn:
        if event.type == "response.output_audio.delta":
            audio_chunks.append(base64.b64decode(event.delta))
        elif event.type == "response.output_audio_transcript.delta":
            transcript_parts.append(event.delta)
        elif event.type == "response.done":
            break

# Convert PCM to WAV (see scripts/pcm_to_wav.py)
pcm_audio = b''.join(audio_chunks)
wav_audio = pcm_to_wav(pcm_audio, sample_rate=24000)
```

### Frontend Audio Playback

```javascript
// Convert base64 WAV to playable blob
const base64ToBlob = (base64, mimeType) => {
  const bytes = atob(base64);
  const arr = new Uint8Array(bytes.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) arr[i] = bytes.charCodeAt(i);
  return new Blob([arr], { type: mimeType });
};

const audioBlob = base64ToBlob(response.audio_data, 'audio/wav');
const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
new Audio(audioUrl).play();
```

#### Imported: Environment Configuration

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_API_KEY=your_realtime_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-realtime-mini
```

**Note**: Endpoint should NOT include `/openai/v1/` - just the base URL.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @podcast-generation-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/podcast-generation-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/podcast-generation-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @podcast-generation-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

1. Configure environment variables for Realtime API
2. Connect via WebSocket to Azure OpenAI Realtime endpoint
3. Send text prompt, collect PCM audio chunks + transcript
4. Convert PCM to WAV format
5. Return base64-encoded audio to frontend for playback

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/podcast-generation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
