# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/wireshark-analysis` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, Inputs / Prerequisites, Outputs / Deliverables.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Execute comprehensive network traffic analysis using Wireshark to capture, filter, and examine network packets for security investigations, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Launch Wireshark
2. Select network interface from main screen
3. Click shark fin icon or double-click interface
4. Capture begins immediately
5. Action - Shortcut - Description
6. Start/Stop Capture - Ctrl+E - Toggle capture on/off
7. Restart Capture - Ctrl+R - Stop and start new capture

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Capturing Network Traffic

#### Start Live Capture
Begin capturing packets on network interface:

```
1. Launch Wireshark
2. Select network interface from main screen
3. Click shark fin icon or double-click interface
4. Capture begins immediately
```

#### Capture Controls
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Start/Stop Capture | Ctrl+E | Toggle capture on/off |
| Restart Capture | Ctrl+R | Stop and start new capture |
| Open PCAP File | Ctrl+O | Load existing capture file |
| Save Capture | Ctrl+S | Save current capture |

#### Capture Filters
Apply filters before capture to limit data collection:

```
# Capture only specific host
host 192.168.1.100

# Capture specific port
port 80

# Capture specific network
net 192.168.1.0/24

# Exclude specific traffic
not arp

# Combine filters
host 192.168.1.100 and port 443
```

### Phase 2: Display Filters

#### Basic Filter Syntax
Filter captured packets for analysis:

```
# IP address filters
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1              # All traffic to/from IP
ip.src == 192.168.1.1               # Source IP only
ip.dst == 192.168.1.1               # Destination IP only

# Port filters
tcp.port == 80                       # TCP port 80
udp.port == 53                       # UDP port 53
tcp.dstport == 443                   # Destination port 443
tcp.srcport == 22                    # Source port 22
```

#### Protocol Filters
Filter by specific protocols:

```
# Common protocols
http                                  # HTTP traffic
https or ssl or tls                   # Encrypted web traffic
dns                                   # DNS queries and responses
ftp                                   # FTP traffic
ssh                                   # SSH traffic
icmp                                  # Ping/ICMP traffic
arp                                   # ARP requests/responses
dhcp                                  # DHCP traffic
smb or smb2                          # SMB file sharing
```

#### TCP Flag Filters
Identify specific connection states:

```
tcp.flags.syn == 1                   # SYN packets (connection attempts)
tcp.flags.ack == 1                   # ACK packets
tcp.flags.fin == 1                   # FIN packets (connection close)
tcp.flags.reset == 1                 # RST packets (connection reset)
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # SYN-only (initial connection)
```

#### Content Filters
Search for specific content:

```
frame contains "password"            # Packets containing string
http.request.uri contains "login"    # HTTP URIs with string
tcp contains "GET"                   # TCP packets with string
```

#### Analysis Filters
Identify potential issues:

```
tcp.analysis.retransmission          # TCP retransmissions
tcp.analysis.duplicate_ack           # Duplicate ACKs
tcp.analysis.zero_window             # Zero window (flow control)
tcp.analysis.flags                   # Packets with issues
dns.flags.rcode != 0                 # DNS errors
```

#### Combining Filters
Use logical operators for complex queries:

```
# AND operator
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 && tcp.port == 80

# OR operator
dns || http

# NOT operator
!(arp || icmp)

# Complex combinations
(ip.src == 192.168.1.1 || ip.src == 192.168.1.2) && tcp.port == 443
```

### Phase 3: Following Streams

#### TCP Stream Reconstruction
View complete TCP conversation:

```
1. Right-click on any TCP packet
2. Select Follow > TCP Stream
3. View reconstructed conversation
4. Toggle between ASCII, Hex, Raw views
5. Filter to show only this stream
```

#### Stream Types
| Stream | Access | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| TCP Stream | Follow > TCP Stream | Web, file transfers, any TCP |
| UDP Stream | Follow > UDP Stream | DNS, VoIP, streaming |
| HTTP Stream | Follow > HTTP Stream | Web content, headers |
| TLS Stream | Follow > TLS Stream | Encrypted traffic (if keys available) |

#### Stream Analysis Tips
- Review request/response pairs
- Identify transmitted files or data
- Look for credentials in plaintext
- Note unusual patterns or commands

### Phase 4: Statistical Analysis

#### Protocol Hierarchy
View protocol distribution:

```
Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy

Shows:
- Percentage of each protocol
- Packet counts
- Bytes transferred
- Protocol breakdown tree
```

#### Conversations
Analyze communication pairs:

```
Statistics > Conversations

Tabs:
- Ethernet: MAC address pairs
- IPv4/IPv6: IP address pairs
- TCP: Connection details (ports, bytes, packets)
- UDP: Datagram exchanges
```

#### Endpoints
View active network participants:

```
Statistics > Endpoints

Shows:
- All source/destination addresses
- Packet and byte counts
- Geographic information (if enabled)
```

#### Flow Graph
Visualize packet sequence:

```
Statistics > Flow Graph

Options:
- All packets or displayed only
- Standard or TCP flow
- Shows packet timing and direction
```

#### I/O Graphs
Plot traffic over time:

```
Statistics > I/O Graph

Features:
- Packets per second
- Bytes per second
- Custom filter graphs
- Multiple graph overlays
```

### Phase 5: Security Analysis

#### Detect Port Scanning
Identify reconnaissance activity:

```
# SYN scan detection (many ports, same source)
ip.src == SUSPECT_IP && tcp.flags.syn == 1

# Review Statistics > Conversations for anomalies
# Look for single source hitting many destination ports
```

#### Identify Suspicious Traffic
Filter for anomalies:

```
# Traffic to unusual ports
tcp.dstport > 1024 && tcp.dstport < 49152

# Traffic outside trusted network
!(ip.addr == 192.168.1.0/24)

# Unusual DNS queries
dns.qry.name contains "suspicious-domain"

# Large data transfers
frame.len > 1400
```

#### ARP Spoofing Detection
Identify ARP attacks:

```
# Duplicate ARP responses
arp.duplicate-address-frame

# ARP traffic analysis
arp

# Look for:
# - Multiple MACs for same IP
# - Gratuitous ARP floods
# - Unusual ARP patterns
```

#### Examine Downloads
Analyze file transfers:

```
# HTTP file downloads
http.request.method == "GET" && http contains "Content-Disposition"

# Follow HTTP Stream to view file content
# Use File > Export Objects > HTTP to extract files
```

#### DNS Analysis
Investigate DNS activity:

```
# All DNS traffic
dns

# DNS queries only
dns.flags.response == 0

# DNS responses only
dns.flags.response == 1

# Failed DNS lookups
dns.flags.rcode != 0

# Specific domain queries
dns.qry.name contains "domain.com"
```

### Phase 6: Expert Information

#### Access Expert Analysis
View Wireshark's automated findings:

```
Analyze > Expert Information

Categories:
- Errors: Critical issues
- Warnings: Potential problems
- Notes: Informational items
- Chats: Normal conversation events
```

#### Common Expert Findings
| Finding | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| TCP Retransmission | Packet resent | Check for packet loss |
| Duplicate ACK | Possible loss | Investigate network path |
| Zero Window | Buffer full | Check receiver performance |
| RST | Connection reset | Check for blocks/errors |
| Out-of-Order | Packets reordered | Usually normal, excessive is issue |

#### Imported: Purpose

Execute comprehensive network traffic analysis using Wireshark to capture, filter, and examine network packets for security investigations, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. This skill enables systematic analysis of network protocols, detection of anomalies, and reconstruction of network conversations from PCAP files.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @wireshark-analysis to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @wireshark-analysis against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @wireshark-analysis for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @wireshark-analysis using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: HTTP Credential Analysis

**Scenario**: Investigate potential plaintext credential transmission

```
1. Filter: http.request.method == "POST"
2. Look for login forms
3. Follow HTTP Stream
4. Search for username/password parameters
```

**Finding**: Credentials transmitted in cleartext form data.

### Example 2: Malware C2 Detection

**Scenario**: Identify command and control traffic

```
1. Filter: dns
2. Look for unusual query patterns
3. Check for high-frequency beaconing
4. Identify domains with random-looking names
5. Filter: ip.dst == SUSPICIOUS_IP
6. Analyze traffic patterns
```

**Indicators**:
- Regular timing intervals
- Encoded/encrypted payloads
- Unusual ports or protocols

### Example 3: Network Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: Diagnose slow web application

```
1. Filter: ip.addr == WEB_SERVER
2. Check Statistics > Service Response Time
3. Filter: tcp.analysis.retransmission
4. Review I/O Graph for patterns
5. Check for high latency or packet loss
```

**Finding**: TCP retransmissions indicating network congestion.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Capture only authorized network traffic
- Handle captured data according to privacy policies
- Avoid capturing sensitive credentials unnecessarily
- Properly secure PCAP files containing sensitive data
- Large captures consume significant memory
- Encrypted traffic content not visible without keys
- High-speed networks may drop packets

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Constraints and Guardrails

### Operational Boundaries
- Capture only authorized network traffic
- Handle captured data according to privacy policies
- Avoid capturing sensitive credentials unnecessarily
- Properly secure PCAP files containing sensitive data

### Technical Limitations
- Large captures consume significant memory
- Encrypted traffic content not visible without keys
- High-speed networks may drop packets
- Some protocols require plugins for full decoding

### Best Practices
- Use capture filters to limit data collection
- Save captures regularly during long sessions
- Use display filters rather than deleting packets
- Document analysis findings and methodology

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/wireshark-analysis`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

### No Packets Captured
- Verify correct interface selected
- Check for admin/root permissions
- Confirm network adapter is active
- Disable promiscuous mode if issues persist

### Filter Not Working
- Verify filter syntax (red = error)
- Check for typos in field names
- Use Expression button for valid fields
- Clear filter and rebuild incrementally

### Performance Issues
- Use capture filters to limit traffic
- Split large captures into smaller files
- Disable name resolution during capture
- Close unnecessary protocol dissectors

### Cannot Decrypt TLS/SSL
- Obtain server private key
- Configure at Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS
- For ephemeral keys, capture pre-master secret from browser
- Some modern ciphers cannot be decrypted passively
