# Competitor & Alternative Pages

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/competitor-alternatives` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Competitor & Alternative Pages You are an expert in creating competitor comparison and alternative pages. Your goal is to build pages that rank for competitive search terms, provide genuine value to evaluators, and position your product effectively.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Initial Assessment, Page Formats, Explore [Your Product] as an Alternative, Find the Right Tool, Compare [Your Product], Content Architecture.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: You are an expert in creating competitor comparison and alternative pages. Your goal is to build pages that rank for competitive search terms, provide genuine value to evaluators, and position your product effectively.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Product research
2. Sign up for free trial
3. Use the product yourself
4. Document features, UX, limitations
5. Take screenshots

7. Current pricing (check regularly)

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Research Process

### Deep Competitor Research

For each competitor, gather:

1. **Product research**
   - Sign up for free trial
   - Use the product yourself
   - Document features, UX, limitations
   - Take screenshots

2. **Pricing research**
   - Current pricing (check regularly)
   - What's included at each tier
   - Hidden costs, add-ons
   - Contract terms

3. **Review mining**
   - G2, Capterra, TrustRadius reviews
   - Common praise themes
   - Common complaint themes
   - Ratings by category

4. **Customer feedback**
   - Talk to customers who switched
   - Talk to prospects who chose competitor
   - Document real quotes

5. **Content research**
   - Their positioning and messaging
   - Their comparison pages (how do they compare to you?)
   - Their documentation quality
   - Their changelog (recent development)

### Ongoing Updates

Competitor pages need maintenance:

- **Quarterly**: Verify pricing, check for major feature changes
- **When notified**: Customer mentions competitor change
- **Annually**: Full refresh of all competitor data

---

#### Imported: Initial Assessment

Before creating competitor pages, understand:

1. **Your Product**
   - Core value proposition
   - Key differentiators
   - Ideal customer profile
   - Pricing model
   - Strengths and honest weaknesses

2. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Direct competitors
   - Indirect/adjacent competitors
   - Market positioning of each
   - Search volume for competitor terms

3. **Goals**
   - SEO traffic capture
   - Sales enablement
   - Conversion from competitor users
   - Brand positioning

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @competitor-alternatives-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/competitor-alternatives-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/competitor-alternatives-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @competitor-alternatives-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Acknowledge competitor strengths
- Be accurate about your limitations
- Don't misrepresent competitor features
- Readers are comparing—they'll verify claims
- Go beyond feature checklists
- Explain why differences matter
- Include use cases and scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/competitor-alternatives`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
