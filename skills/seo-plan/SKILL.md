# Strategic SEO Planning

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/seo-plan` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Strategic SEO Planning

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Industry Templates, Output, DataForSEO Integration (Optional), Error Handling, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when building an SEO strategy or roadmap for a new or existing site.
- Use when planning content, architecture, and implementation phases together.
- Use when the user asks for an SEO plan rather than a point-in-time audit.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: >.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `assets/agency.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `assets/ecommerce.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Business type, target audience, competitors, goals
2. Current site assessment (if exists)
3. Budget and timeline constraints
4. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
5. Identify top 5 competitors
6. Analyze their content strategy, schema usage, technical setup
7. Identify keyword gaps and content opportunities

Load from `assets/` directory:
- `saas.md`: SaaS/software companies

- `publisher.md`: Content publishers/media
- `agency.md`: Agencies and consultancies
- `generic.md`: General business template

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @seo-plan to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @seo-plan against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @seo-plan for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @seo-plan using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/seo-plan`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/agency.md` |

### Success Criteria
- Clear, measurable goals per phase
- Resource requirements defined
- Dependencies identified
- Risk mitigation strategies

#### Imported: DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, use `dataforseo_labs_google_competitors_domain` and `dataforseo_labs_google_domain_intersection` for real competitive intelligence, `dataforseo_labs_bulk_traffic_estimation` for traffic estimates, `kw_data_google_ads_search_volume` and `dataforseo_labs_bulk_keyword_difficulty` for keyword research, and `business_data_business_listings_search` for local business data.

#### Imported: Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Unrecognized business type | Fall back to `generic.md` template. Inform user that no industry-specific template was found and proceed with the general business template. |
| No website URL provided | Proceed with new-site planning mode. Skip current site assessment and competitive gap analysis that require a live URL. |
| Industry template not found | Check `assets/` directory for available templates. If the requested template file is missing, use `generic.md` and note the missing template in output. |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
