# PayPal Integration

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-bundle-commerce-payments/skills/paypal-integration` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# PayPal Integration Master PayPal payment integration including Express Checkout, IPN handling, recurring billing, and refund workflows.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Concepts, Express Checkout Implementation, IPN (Instant Payment Notification) Handling, Subscription/Recurring Billing, Error Handling, Testing.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to paypal integration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Integrating PayPal as a payment option
- Implementing express checkout flows
- Setting up recurring billing with PayPal
- Processing refunds and payment disputes

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

#### Imported: Refund Workflows

```python
def create_refund(capture_id, amount=None, note=None):
    """Create a refund for a captured payment."""
    client = PayPalClient(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)

    url = f"{client.base_url}/v2/payments/captures/{capture_id}/refund"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {client.access_token}"
    }

    payload = {}
    if amount:
        payload["amount"] = {
            "value": str(amount),
            "currency_code": "USD"
        }

    if note:
        payload["note_to_payer"] = note

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()

def get_refund_details(refund_id):
    """Get refund details."""
    client = PayPalClient(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)

    url = f"{client.base_url}/v2/payments/refunds/{refund_id}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {client.access_token}"
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

#### Imported: Core Concepts

### 1. Payment Products
**PayPal Checkout**
- One-time payments
- Express checkout experience
- Guest and PayPal account payments

**PayPal Subscriptions**
- Recurring billing
- Subscription plans
- Automatic renewals

**PayPal Payouts**
- Send money to multiple recipients
- Marketplace and platform payments

### 2. Integration Methods
**Client-Side (JavaScript SDK)**
- Smart Payment Buttons
- Hosted payment flow
- Minimal backend code

**Server-Side (REST API)**
- Full control over payment flow
- Custom checkout UI
- Advanced features

### 3. IPN (Instant Payment Notification)
- Webhook-like payment notifications
- Asynchronous payment updates
- Verification required

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @paypal-integration-v3 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @paypal-integration-v3 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @paypal-integration-v3 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @paypal-integration-v3 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

```javascript
// Frontend - PayPal Smart Buttons
<div id="paypal-button-container"></div>

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&currency=USD"></script>
<script>
  paypal.Buttons({
    createOrder: function(data, actions) {
      return actions.order.create({
        purchase_units: [{
          amount: {
            value: '25.00'
          }
        }]
      });
    },
    onApprove: function(data, actions) {
      return actions.order.capture().then(function(details) {
        // Payment successful
        console.log('Transaction completed by ' + details.payer.name.given_name);

        // Send to backend for verification
        fetch('/api/paypal/capture', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
          body: JSON.stringify({orderID: data.orderID})
        });
      });
    }
  }).render('#paypal-button-container');
</script>
```

```python
# Backend - Verify and capture order
from paypalrestsdk import Payment
import paypalrestsdk

paypalrestsdk.configure({
    "mode": "sandbox",  # or "live"
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
})

def capture_paypal_order(order_id):
    """Capture a PayPal order."""
    payment = Payment.find(order_id)

    if payment.execute({"payer_id": payment.payer.payer_info.payer_id}):
        # Payment successful
        return {
            'status': 'success',
            'transaction_id': payment.id,
            'amount': payment.transactions[0].amount.total
        }
    else:
        # Payment failed
        return {
            'status': 'failed',
            'error': payment.error
        }
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Always Verify IPN: Never trust IPN without verification
- Idempotent Processing: Handle duplicate IPN notifications
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling
- Logging: Log all transactions and errors
- Test Thoroughly: Use sandbox extensively
- Webhook Backup: Don't rely solely on client-side callbacks
- Currency Handling: Always specify currency explicitly

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-bundle-commerce-payments/skills/paypal-integration`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

- **Not Verifying IPN**: Accepting IPN without verification
- **Duplicate Processing**: Not checking for duplicate transactions
- **Wrong Environment**: Mixing sandbox and production URLs/credentials
- **Missing Webhooks**: Not handling all payment states
- **Hardcoded Values**: Not making configurable for different environments

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
