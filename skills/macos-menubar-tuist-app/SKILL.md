# macos-menubar-tuist-app

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/macos-menubar-tuist-app` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# macos-menubar-tuist-app Build and maintain macOS menubar apps with a Tuist-first workflow and stable launch scripts. Preserve strict architecture boundaries so networking, state, and UI remain testable and predictable.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Completion Checklist, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- When working on LSUIElement menubar utilities built with Tuist and SwiftUI.
- When you need Tuist manifests, launch scripts, or architecture guidance for a menubar app.
- Project.swift: app target, settings, resources, Info.plist keys
- Sources/Model.swift: API/domain models and decoding
- Sources/Client.swift: requests, response mapping, transport concerns
- Sources/Store.swift: observable state, refresh policy, filtering, caching

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `agents/openai.yaml` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `agents/openai.yaml` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm Tuist ownership
2. Verify Tuist.swift and Project.swift (or workspace manifests) exist.
3. Read existing run scripts before changing launch behavior.
4. Probe backend behavior before coding assumptions
5. Use curl to verify endpoint shape, auth requirements, and pagination behavior.
6. If endpoint ignores limit/page, implement full-list handling with local trimming in the store.
7. Implement layers from bottom to top

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

1. Confirm Tuist ownership
- Verify `Tuist.swift` and `Project.swift` (or workspace manifests) exist.
- Read existing run scripts before changing launch behavior.

2. Probe backend behavior before coding assumptions
- Use `curl` to verify endpoint shape, auth requirements, and pagination behavior.
- If endpoint ignores `limit/page`, implement full-list handling with local trimming in the store.

3. Implement layers from bottom to top
- Define/adjust models first.
- Add or update client request/decoding logic.
- Update store refresh, filtering, and cache policy.
- Wire views last.

4. Keep app wiring minimal
- Keep app entry focused on scene/menu wiring and dependency injection.
- Avoid embedding business logic in `App` or menu scene declarations.

5. Standardize launch ergonomics
- Ensure run script restarts an existing instance before relaunching.
- Ensure run script does not open Xcode as a side effect.
- Use `tuist generate --no-open` when generation is required.
- When the run script builds the generated project, prefer `TUIST_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1 tuist xcodebuild build ...` instead of invoking raw `xcodebuild` directly.

#### Imported: Completion Checklist

- Preserve menubar-only behavior unless explicitly changed.
- Keep network and state logic out of SwiftUI view bodies.
- Keep Tuist manifests and run scripts aligned with actual build/run flow.
- Run the validation matrix for touched areas.
- Report concrete commands run and outcomes.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @macos-menubar-tuist-app to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @macos-menubar-tuist-app against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @macos-menubar-tuist-app for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @macos-menubar-tuist-app using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the app menubar-only unless explicitly told otherwise. Use LSUIElement = true by default.
- Keep transport and decoding logic outside views. Do not call networking from SwiftUI view bodies.
- Keep state transitions in a store layer (@Observable or equivalent), not in row/view presentation code.
- Keep model decoding resilient to API drift: optional fields, safe fallbacks, and defensive parsing.
- Treat Tuist manifests as the source of truth. Do not rely on hand-edited generated Xcode artifacts.
- Prefer script-based launch for local iteration when tuist run is unreliable for macOS target/device resolution.
- Prefer tuist xcodebuild build over raw xcodebuild in local run scripts when building generated projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/macos-menubar-tuist-app`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Failure Patterns and Fix Direction

- `tuist run` cannot resolve the macOS destination:
Use run/stop scripts as canonical local run path.

- Menu UI is laggy or inconsistent after refresh:
Move derived state and filtering into the store; keep views render-only.

- API payload changes break decode:
Relax model decoding with optional fields and defaults, then surface missing data safely in UI.

- Feature asks for quick UI patch:
Trace root cause in model/client/store before changing row/menu presentation.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/openai.yaml` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Validation Matrix

Run validations after edits:

```bash
TUIST_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1 tuist xcodebuild build -scheme <TargetName> -configuration Debug
```

If launch workflow changed:

```bash
./run-menubar.sh
```

If shell scripts changed:

```bash
bash -n run-menubar.sh
bash -n stop-menubar.sh
./run-menubar.sh
```

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
