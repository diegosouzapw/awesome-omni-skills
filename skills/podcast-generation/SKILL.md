# Podcast Generation with GPT Realtime Mini

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/podcast-generation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Podcast Generation with GPT Realtime Mini Generate real audio narratives from text content using Azure OpenAI's Realtime API.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Environment Configuration, Voice Options, Realtime API Events, Audio Format, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generate real audio narratives from text content using Azure OpenAI's Realtime API.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

3. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
4. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
5. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
6. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
7. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Workflow

### Backend Audio Generation

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import base64

# Convert HTTPS endpoint to WebSocket URL
ws_url = endpoint.replace("https://", "wss://") + "/openai/v1"

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    websocket_base_url=ws_url,
    api_key=api_key
)

audio_chunks = []
transcript_parts = []

async with client.realtime.connect(model="gpt-realtime-mini") as conn:
    # Configure for audio-only output
    await conn.session.update(session={
        "output_modalities": ["audio"],
        "instructions": "You are a narrator. Speak naturally."
    })

    # Send text to narrate
    await conn.conversation.item.create(item={
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": prompt}]
    })

    await conn.response.create()

    # Collect streaming events
    async for event in conn:
        if event.type == "response.output_audio.delta":
            audio_chunks.append(base64.b64decode(event.delta))
        elif event.type == "response.output_audio_transcript.delta":
            transcript_parts.append(event.delta)
        elif event.type == "response.done":
            break

# Convert PCM to WAV (see scripts/pcm_to_wav.py)
pcm_audio = b''.join(audio_chunks)
wav_audio = pcm_to_wav(pcm_audio, sample_rate=24000)
```

### Frontend Audio Playback

```javascript
// Convert base64 WAV to playable blob
const base64ToBlob = (base64, mimeType) => {
  const bytes = atob(base64);
  const arr = new Uint8Array(bytes.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) arr[i] = bytes.charCodeAt(i);
  return new Blob([arr], { type: mimeType });
};

const audioBlob = base64ToBlob(response.audio_data, 'audio/wav');
const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
new Audio(audioUrl).play();
```

#### Imported: Environment Configuration

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_API_KEY=your_realtime_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-realtime-mini
```

**Note**: Endpoint should NOT include `/openai/v1/` - just the base URL.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @podcast-generation to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @podcast-generation against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @podcast-generation for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @podcast-generation using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

1. Configure environment variables for Realtime API
2. Connect via WebSocket to Azure OpenAI Realtime endpoint
3. Send text prompt, collect PCM audio chunks + transcript
4. Convert PCM to WAV format
5. Return base64-encoded audio to frontend for playback

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/podcast-generation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
