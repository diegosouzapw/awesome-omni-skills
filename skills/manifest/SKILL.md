# Manifest Setup

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/manifest` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Manifest Setup Follow these steps in order. Do not skip ahead.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Safety, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User wants to set up observability or telemetry for their agent
- User wants to connect their agent to Manifest for monitoring
- User needs to configure a Manifest API key or custom endpoint
- User is troubleshooting Manifest plugin connection issues
- User wants to verify the Manifest plugin is running
- User needs general observability design (use observability-engineer instead)

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. ### Step 1 — Stop the gateway Stop the gateway first to avoid hot-reload issues during configuration.
2. `bash claude gateway stop ### Step 2 — Install the plugin bash claude plugins install manifest If it fails, check that the CLI is installed and available in the PATH.
3. ### Step 3 — Get an API key Ask the user: > To connect your agent, you need a Manifest API key.
4. Here's how to get one: > > 1.
5. Go to https://app.manifest.build and create an account (or sign in) > 2.
6. Once logged in, click "Connect Agent" to create a new agent > 3.
7. Copy the API key that starts with mnfst > 4.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

### Step 1 — Stop the gateway

Stop the gateway first to avoid hot-reload issues during configuration.

```bash
claude gateway stop
```

### Step 2 — Install the plugin

```bash
claude plugins install manifest
```

If it fails, check that the CLI is installed and available in the PATH.

### Step 3 — Get an API key

Ask the user:

> To connect your agent, you need a Manifest API key. Here's how to get one:
>
> 1. Go to **https://app.manifest.build** and create an account (or sign in)
> 2. Once logged in, click **"Connect Agent"** to create a new agent
> 3. Copy the API key that starts with `mnfst_`
> 4. Paste it here

Wait for a key starting with `mnfst_`. If the key doesn't match, tell the user the format looks incorrect and ask them to try again.

### Step 4 — Configure the plugin

```bash
claude config set plugins.entries.manifest.config.apiKey "USER_API_KEY"
```

Replace `USER_API_KEY` with the actual key the user provided.

Ask the user if they have a custom endpoint. If not, the default (`https://app.manifest.build/api/v1/otlp`) is used automatically. If they do:

```bash
claude config set plugins.entries.manifest.config.endpoint "USER_ENDPOINT"
```

### Step 5 — Start the gateway

```bash
claude gateway install
```

### Step 6 — Verify

Wait 3 seconds for the gateway to fully start, then check the logs:

```bash
grep "manifest" ~/.claude/logs/gateway.log | tail -5
```

Look for:

```
[manifest] Observability pipeline active
```

If it appears, tell the user setup is complete. If not, check the error messages and troubleshoot.

#### Imported: Safety

- Never log or echo the API key in plain text after configuration
- Verify the key format (`mnfst_` prefix) before writing to config

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @manifest to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @manifest against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @manifest for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @manifest using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Basic setup

```
Use @manifest to set up observability for my agent.
```

### Example 2: Custom endpoint

```
Use @manifest to connect my agent to my self-hosted Manifest instance at https://manifest.internal.company.com/api/v1/otlp
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Always stop the gateway before making configuration changes
- The default endpoint works for most users — only change it if self-hosting
- API keys always start with mnfst_ — any other format is invalid
- Check gateway logs first when debugging any plugin issue
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/manifest`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Missing apiKey | Re-run step 4 |
| Invalid apiKey format | The key must start with `mnfst_` |
| Connection refused | The endpoint is unreachable. Check the URL or ask if they self-host |
| Duplicate OTel registration | Disable the conflicting built-in plugin: `claude plugins disable diagnostics-otel` |
