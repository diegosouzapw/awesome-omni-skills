# Odoo Migration Helper

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-migration-helper` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Odoo Migration Helper

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Key Migration Changes by Version, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Upgrading a custom module from Odoo 14/15/16 to a newer version.
- Getting a checklist of things to check before running odoo-upgrade.
- Fixing deprecation warnings after a version upgrade.
- Understanding what changed between two specific Odoo versions.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Step-by-step guide for migrating Odoo custom modules between versions (v14→v15→v16→v17). Covers API changes, deprecated methods, and view migration.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Migrating Odoo modules between major versions requires careful handling of API changes, deprecated methods, renamed fields, and new view syntax. This skill guides you through the migration process systematically, covering the most common breaking changes between versions.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-migration-helper`, specify your source and target versions, and paste your module code.
2. **Analyze**: Receive a list of breaking changes with before/after code fixes.
3. **Validate**: Get a migration checklist specific to your module's features.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @odoo-migration-helper-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-migration-helper-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-migration-helper-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @odoo-migration-helper-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Migrate `attrs` visibility to Odoo 17

```xml
<!-- v16 — domain-based attrs -->
<field name="discount" attrs="{'invisible': [('product_type', '!=', 'service')]}"/>
<field name="discount" attrs="{'required': [('state', '=', 'sale')]}"/>

<!-- v17 — inline Python expressions -->
<field name="discount" invisible="product_type != 'service'"/>
<field name="discount" required="state == 'sale'"/>
```

### Example 2: Migrate Chatter block

```xml
<!-- v16 -->
<div class="oe_chatter">
    <field name="message_follower_ids"/>
    <field name="activity_ids"/>
    <field name="message_ids"/>
</div>

<!-- v17 -->
<chatter/>
```

### Example 3: Migrate website_published flag (v15 → v16)

```python
# v15
record.website_published = True

# v16+
record.is_published = True
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ✅ Do: Test with --update=your_module on each version before pushing to production.
- ✅ Do: Use the official Odoo Upgrade Guide to get an automated pre-upgrade analysis report.
- ✅ Do: Check OCA migration notes and the module's HISTORY.rst for community modules.
- ✅ Do: Run npm run validate after migration to catch manifest or frontmatter issues early.
- ❌ Don't: Skip intermediate versions — go v14→v15→v16→v17 sequentially; never jump.
- ❌ Don't: Forget to update version in manifest.py (e.g., 17.0.1.0.0).
- ❌ Don't: Assume OCA modules are migration-ready; check their GitHub branch for the target version.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/odoo-migration-helper`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Key Migration Changes by Version

### Odoo 16 → 17

| Topic | Old (v16) | New (v17) |
|---|---|---|
| View visibility | `attrs="{'invisible': [...]}"` | `invisible="condition"` |
| Chatter | `<div class="oe_chatter">` | `<chatter/>` |
| Required/Readonly | `attrs="{'required': [...]}"` | `required="condition"` |
| Python minimum | 3.10 | 3.10+ |

### Odoo 15 → 16

| Topic | Old (v15) | New (v16) |
|---|---|---|
| Website published flag | `website_published = True` | `is_published = True` |
| Mail aliases | `alias_domain` on company | Moved to `mail.alias.domain` model |
| Report render | `_render_qweb_pdf()` | `_render_qweb_pdf()` (same, but signature changed) |
| Accounting move | `account.move.line` grouping | Line aggregation rules updated |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Covers **v14 through v17** only — does not address v13 or older (pre-manifest era has fundamentally different module structure).
- The **Odoo.sh automated upgrade** path has additional steps not covered here; refer to Odoo.sh documentation.
- **Enterprise-specific modules** (e.g., `account_accountant`, `sign`) may have undocumented breaking changes; test on a staging environment with Enterprise license.
- JavaScript OWL component migration (v15 Legacy → v16 OWL) is a complex topic not fully covered by this skill.
