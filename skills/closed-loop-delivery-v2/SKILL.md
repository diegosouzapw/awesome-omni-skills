# Closed-Loop Delivery

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/closed-loop-delivery` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Closed-Loop Delivery

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Required Inputs, Issue Gate Dependency, Iteration/Stop Conditions, Output Contract, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- user gives a coding/fix task and expects end-to-end completion
- task spans code + tests + PR comments + dev deploy + runtime checks
- repeated manual prompts like "now test", "now deploy", "now re-check PR" should be avoided
- pure Q&A/explanations
- prod deploy requests without explicit human approval
- tasks blocked by missing secrets/account access that cannot be inferred

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Define DoD
2. Convert request into testable criteria.
3. Example: checkout task DoD = "checkout endpoint returns a valid, openable third-party payment URL in dev".
4. Implement minimal change
5. Keep scope tight to task goal.
6. Verify locally
7. Run focused tests first, then broader checks if needed.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Default Workflow

1. **Define DoD**
   - Convert request into testable criteria.
   - Example: checkout task DoD = "checkout endpoint returns a valid, openable third-party payment URL in dev".

2. **Implement minimal change**
   - Keep scope tight to task goal.

3. **Verify locally**
   - Run focused tests first, then broader checks if needed.

4. **Review loop**
   - Fetch PR comments/reviews.
   - Classify valid vs non-actionable.
   - Fix valid items, re-run verification.

5. **Dev deploy + runtime verification**
   - Deploy to `dev` when runtime behavior matters.
   - Verify via real API/Lambda/log evidence against DoD.

6. **Completion decision**
   - Only report "done" when all DoD checks pass.
   - Otherwise continue loop until pass or stop condition.

#### Imported: Overview

Treat each task as incomplete until acceptance criteria are verified in evidence, not until code is merely changed.

Core rule: **deliver against DoD (Definition of Done), not against code diff size.**

#### Imported: Required Inputs

Before execution, define these once:
- task goal
- acceptance criteria (DoD)
- target environment (`dev` by default)
- max iteration rounds (default `2`)

If acceptance criteria are missing, request them once. If user does not provide, propose a concrete default and proceed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @closed-loop-delivery-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/closed-loop-delivery-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/closed-loop-delivery-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @closed-loop-delivery-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Round 1: wait 3m, collect delta comments/reviews
- Round 2: wait 6m, collect delta again
- Final round: wait 10m, collect all remaining visible comments/reviews
- process all new comments in one batch
- avoid immediate re-poll after each single comment
- after the 10m round, stop waiting and proceed with all comments visible at that point
- production/staging deploy beyond agreed scope

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: PR Comment Polling Policy

Avoid noisy short polling by default. Use batched windows:

- **Round 1:** wait `3m`, collect delta comments/reviews
- **Round 2:** wait `6m`, collect delta again
- **Final round:** wait `10m`, collect all remaining visible comments/reviews

At each round:
- process all new comments in one batch
- avoid immediate re-poll after each single comment
- after the `10m` round, stop waiting and proceed with all comments visible at that point

If CI is still running, align polling to check completion boundaries instead of fixed rapid polling.

#### Imported: Human Gate Rules (Must Ask)

Require explicit user confirmation for:
- production/staging deploy beyond agreed scope
- destructive operations (history rewrite, force push, data-destructive ops)
- actions with billing/security posture changes
- secret values not available in repo/runtime
- ambiguous DoD that materially changes outcome

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/closed-loop-delivery`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Issue Gate Dependency

Before execution, prefer using `create-issue-gate`.

- If issue status is `ready` and execution gate is `allowed`, continue.
- If issue status is `draft`, do not execute implementation/deploy/review loops.
- Require user-provided, testable acceptance criteria before starting execution.

#### Imported: Iteration/Stop Conditions

Stop and escalate with a concise blocker report when:
- DoD still fails after max rounds (`2` default)
- external dependency blocks progress (provider outage, missing creds, account permission)
- conflicting review instructions cannot both be satisfied

Escalation report must include:
- what passed
- what failed
- evidence (commands/logs/API result)
- smallest decision needed from user

#### Imported: Output Contract

When claiming completion, always include:
- acceptance criteria checklist with pass/fail
- commands/tests run
- runtime evidence (endpoint/Lambda/log key lines)
- PR status (new actionable comments count)

Do not claim success without evidence.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
