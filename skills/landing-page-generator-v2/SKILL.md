# Landing Page Generator

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/landing-page-generator` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Landing Page Generator Generate high-converting landing pages from a product description. Output complete Next.js/React components with multiple section variants, proven copy frameworks, SEO optimization, and performance-first patterns. Not lorem ipsum — actual copy that converts. Target: LCP < 1s · CLS < 0.1 · FID < 100ms Output: TSX components + Tailwind styles + SEO meta + copy variants

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Copy Frameworks, Representative Component: Hero (Centered Gradient — Dark SaaS), Other Section Patterns, SEO Checklist, Performance Targets.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to generate a marketing landing page in Next.js or React.
- The task involves conversion-focused page structure, section variants, Tailwind styling, or SEO-aware copy.
- You want complete landing-page output from a product description rather than isolated UI fragments.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generates high-converting Next.js/React landing pages with Tailwind CSS. Uses PAS, AIDA, and BAB frameworks for optimized copy/components (Heroes, Features, Pricing). Focuses on Core Web Vitals/SEO.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Gather inputs — collect product name, tagline, audience, pain point, key benefit, pricing tiers, design style, and copy framework using the trigger format below. Ask only for missing fields.
2. Analyze brand voice (recommended) — if the user has existing brand content (website copy, blog posts, marketing materials), run it through marketing-skill/content-production/scripts/brandvoiceanalyzer.py to get a voice profile (formality, tone, perspective). Use the profile to inform design style and copy framework selection:
3. formal + professional → enterprise style, AIDA framework
4. casual + friendly → bold-startup style, BAB framework
5. professional + authoritative → dark-saas style, PAS framework
6. casual + conversational → clean-minimal style, BAB framework
7. Select design style — map the user's choice (or infer from brand voice analysis) to one of the four Tailwind class sets in the Design Style Reference.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Generation Workflow

Follow these steps in order for every landing page request:

1. **Gather inputs** — collect product name, tagline, audience, pain point, key benefit, pricing tiers, design style, and copy framework using the trigger format below. Ask only for missing fields.
2. **Analyze brand voice** (recommended) — if the user has existing brand content (website copy, blog posts, marketing materials), run it through `marketing-skill/content-production/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py` to get a voice profile (formality, tone, perspective). Use the profile to inform design style and copy framework selection:
   - formal + professional → **enterprise** style, **AIDA** framework
   - casual + friendly → **bold-startup** style, **BAB** framework
   - professional + authoritative → **dark-saas** style, **PAS** framework
   - casual + conversational → **clean-minimal** style, **BAB** framework
3. **Select design style** — map the user's choice (or infer from brand voice analysis) to one of the four Tailwind class sets in the Design Style Reference.
4. **Apply copy framework** — write all headline and body copy using the chosen framework (PAS / AIDA / BAB) before generating components. Match the voice profile's formality and tone throughout.
5. **Generate sections in order** — Hero → Features → Pricing → FAQ → Testimonials → CTA → Footer. Skip sections not relevant to the product.
6. **Validate against SEO checklist** — run through every item in the SEO Checklist before outputting final code. Fix any gaps inline.
7. **Output final components** — deliver complete, copy-paste-ready TSX files with all Tailwind classes, SEO meta, and structured data included.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @landing-page-generator-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/landing-page-generator-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/landing-page-generator-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @landing-page-generator-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/landing-page-generator`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Copy Frameworks

**PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)**
- H1: Painful state they're in
- Sub: What happens if they don't fix it
- CTA: What you offer
- *Example — H1:* "Your team wastes 3 hours a day on manual reporting" / *Sub:* "Every hour spent on spreadsheets is an hour not closing deals. Your competitors are already automated." / *CTA:* "Automate your reports in 10 minutes →"

#### Imported: Other Section Patterns

### Feature Section (Alternating)

Map over a `features` array with `{ title, description, image, badge }`. Toggle layout direction with `i % 2 === 1 ? "lg:flex-row-reverse" : ""`. Use `<Image>` with explicit `width`/`height` and `rounded-2xl shadow-xl`. Wrap in `<section className="py-24">` with `max-w-6xl` container.

### Pricing Table

Map over a `plans` array with `{ name, price, description, features[], cta, highlighted }`. Highlighted plan gets `border-2 border-violet-500 bg-violet-950/50 ring-4 ring-violet-500/20`; others get `border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900`. Render `null` price as "Custom". Use `<Check>` icon per feature row. Layout: `grid gap-8 lg:grid-cols-3`.

### FAQ with Schema Markup

Inject `FAQPage` JSON-LD via `<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }} />` inside the section. Map FAQs with `{ q, a }` into shadcn `<Accordion>` with `type="single" collapsible`. Container: `max-w-3xl`.

### Testimonials, CTA, Footer

- **Testimonials:** Grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`) or single-quote hero block with avatar, name, role, and quote text.
- **CTA Banner:** Full-width section with headline, subhead, and two buttons (primary + ghost). Add trust signals (money-back guarantee, logo strip) immediately below.
- **Footer:** Logo + nav columns + social links + legal. Use `border-t border-gray-800` separator.

#### Imported: SEO Checklist

- [ ] `<title>` tag: primary keyword + brand (50–60 chars)
- [ ] Meta description: benefit + CTA (150–160 chars)
- [ ] OG image: 1200×630px with product name and tagline
- [ ] H1: one per page, includes primary keyword
- [ ] Structured data: FAQPage, Product, or Organization schema
- [ ] Canonical URL set
- [ ] Image alt text on all `<Image>` components
- [ ] robots.txt and sitemap.xml configured
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP < 1s, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Mobile viewport meta tag present
- [ ] Internal linking to pricing and docs

> **Validation step:** Before outputting final code, verify every checklist item above is satisfied. Fix any gaps inline — do not skip items.

---

#### Imported: Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | < 1s | Preload hero image, use `priority` on Next/Image |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Set explicit width/height on all images |
| FID/INP | < 100ms | Defer non-critical JS, use `loading="lazy"` |
| TTFB | < 200ms | Use ISR or static generation for landing pages |
| Bundle | < 100KB JS | Audit with `@next/bundle-analyzer` |

---

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

- Hero image not preloaded — add `priority` prop to first `<Image>`
- Missing mobile breakpoints — always design mobile-first with `sm:` prefixes
- CTA copy too vague — "Get started" beats "Learn more"; "Start free trial" beats "Sign up"
- Pricing page missing trust signals — add money-back guarantee and testimonials near CTA
- No above-the-fold CTA on mobile — ensure button is visible without scrolling on 375px viewport
