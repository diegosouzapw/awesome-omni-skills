# XVARY Stock Research Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/xvary-stock-research` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# XVARY Stock Research Skill Use this skill to produce institutional-depth stock analysis in Claude Code using public EDGAR + market data.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Output Format, Data Tooling, Footer (Required on Every Response), Compliance Notes, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when you need a verdict-style equity memo (constructive / neutral / cautious) grounded in public filings and quotes.
- Use when you want named kill criteria and a four-pillar scorecard (Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, Upside) without a paid data terminal.
- Use when comparing two tickers with /compare and need a structured differential, not a prose-only chat answer.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Thesis-driven equity analysis from public SEC EDGAR and market data; /analyze, /score, /compare workflows with bundled Python tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex).
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Output Format

For `/analyze {ticker}` use this shape:

1. `Verdict` (Constructive / Neutral / Cautious)
2. `Conviction Rationale` (3-5 bullets)
3. `XVARY Scores` (Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, Upside)
4. `Thesis Pillars` (3-5 pillars)
5. `Top Risks` (3 items)
6. `Kill Criteria` (thesis-invalidating conditions)
7. `Financial Snapshot` (revenue, margin proxy, cash flow, leverage snapshot)
8. `Next Checks` (what to watch over next 1-2 quarters)

For `/score {ticker}` use this shape:

1. Score table
2. Factor highlights by score
3. Confidence note

For `/compare {ticker1} vs {ticker2}` use this shape:

1. Score comparison table
2. Where ticker A is stronger
3. Where ticker B is stronger
4. What would change the ranking

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @xvary-stock-research-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/xvary-stock-research-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/xvary-stock-research-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @xvary-stock-research-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Commands

### `/analyze {ticker}`

Run full skill workflow:

1. Pull SEC fundamentals and filing metadata from `tools/edgar.py`.
2. Pull quote and valuation context from `tools/market.py`.
3. Apply framework from `references/methodology.md`.
4. Compute scorecard using `references/scoring.md`.
5. Output structured analysis with verdict, pillars, risks, and kill criteria.

### `/score {ticker}`

Run score-only workflow:

1. Pull minimum required EDGAR and market fields.
2. Compute Momentum, Stability, Financial Health, and Upside Estimate.
3. Return score table + short interpretation + top sensitivity checks.

### `/compare {ticker1} vs {ticker2}`

Run side-by-side workflow:

1. Execute `/score` logic for both tickers.
2. Compare conviction drivers, key risks, and valuation asymmetry.
3. Return winner by setup quality, plus conditions that would flip the view.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Normalize all tickers to uppercase.
- Prefer latest annual + quarterly EDGAR datapoints.
- Cite filing form/date whenever stating a hard financial figure.
- Keep analysis concise but decision-oriented.
- Use plain English, avoid generic finance fluff.
- Never claim certainty; surface assumptions and kill criteria.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/xvary-stock-research`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
