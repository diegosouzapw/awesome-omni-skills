# AWS IAM Best Practices

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/security/aws-iam-best-practices` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# AWS IAM Best Practices Review and harden IAM policies following AWS security best practices and least privilege principles.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: IAM Security Checks, IAM Hardening Checklist, Automated IAM Hardening, Kiro CLI Integration, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use this skill when you need to review IAM policies, implement least privilege access, or harden IAM security.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: IAM policy review, hardening, and least privilege implementation.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: IAM Security Checks

### Find Overly Permissive Policies

```bash
# List policies with full admin access
aws iam list-policies --scope Local \
  --query 'Policies[*].[PolicyName,Arn]' --output table | \
  grep -i admin

# Find policies with wildcard actions
aws iam list-policies --scope Local --query 'Policies[*].Arn' --output text | \
while read arn; do
  version=$(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn "$arn" \
    --query 'Policy.DefaultVersionId' --output text)
  doc=$(aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn "$arn" \
    --version-id "$version" --query 'PolicyVersion.Document')
  if echo "$doc" | grep -q '"Action": "\*"'; then
    echo "Wildcard action in: $arn"
  fi
done

# Find inline policies (should use managed policies)
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text | \
while read user; do
  policies=$(aws iam list-user-policies --user-name "$user" \
    --query 'PolicyNames' --output text)
  if [ -n "$policies" ]; then
    echo "Inline policies on user $user: $policies"
  fi
done
```

### MFA Enforcement

```bash
# List users without MFA
aws iam get-credential-report --output text | \
  awk -F, 'NR>1 && $4=="false" {print $1}'

# Check if MFA is required in policies
aws iam list-policies --scope Local --query 'Policies[*].Arn' --output text | \
while read arn; do
  version=$(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn "$arn" \
    --query 'Policy.DefaultVersionId' --output text)
  doc=$(aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn "$arn" \
    --version-id "$version" --query 'PolicyVersion.Document')
  if echo "$doc" | grep -q "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent"; then
    echo "MFA enforced in: $arn"
  fi
done

# Enable MFA for a user (returns QR code)
aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device \
  --virtual-mfa-device-name user-mfa \
  --outfile /tmp/qr.png \
  --bootstrap-method QRCodePNG
```

### Access Key Management

```bash
# Find old access keys (>90 days)
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text | \
while read user; do
  aws iam list-access-keys --user-name "$user" \
    --query 'AccessKeyMetadata[*].[AccessKeyId,CreateDate,Status]' \
    --output text | \
  while read key_id create_date status; do
    age_days=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$create_date" +%s)) / 86400 ))
    if [ $age_days -gt 90 ]; then
      echo "$user: Key $key_id is $age_days days old"
    fi
  done
done

# Rotate access key
OLD_KEY="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
USER="myuser"

# Create new key
NEW_KEY=$(aws iam create-access-key --user-name "$USER")
echo "New key created. Update applications, then run:"
echo "aws iam delete-access-key --user-name $USER --access-key-id $OLD_KEY"

# Deactivate old key (test first)
aws iam update-access-key \
  --user-name "$USER" \
  --access-key-id "$OLD_KEY" \
  --status Inactive
```

### Role and Policy Analysis

```bash
# List unused roles (no activity in 90 days)
aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[*].[RoleName,RoleLastUsed.LastUsedDate]' \
  --output text | \
while read role last_used; do
  if [ "$last_used" = "None" ]; then
    echo "Never used: $role"
  fi
done

# Find roles with trust relationships to external accounts
aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[*].RoleName' --output text | \
while read role; do
  trust=$(aws iam get-role --role-name "$role" \
    --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument')
  if echo "$trust" | grep -q '"AWS":'; then
    echo "External trust: $role"
  fi
done

# Analyze policy permissions
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/myuser \
  --action-names s3:GetObject s3:PutObject \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @aws-iam-best-practices to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @aws-iam-best-practices against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @aws-iam-best-practices for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @aws-iam-best-practices using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Example Prompts

- "Review my IAM policies for security issues"
- "Find users without MFA enabled"
- "Create a least privilege policy for S3 access"
- "Identify overly permissive IAM roles"
- "Generate an IAM hardening report"

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Grant minimum permissions needed
- Use managed policies when possible
- Avoid wildcard (*) permissions
- Regular access reviews
- Enable MFA for all users
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Implement service control policies (SCPs)

#### Imported: Best Practices

- Use AWS managed policies when possible
- Implement policy versioning
- Test policies in non-production first
- Document policy purposes
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Use IAM Access Analyzer
- Implement SCPs for organization-wide controls

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/security/aws-iam-best-practices`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
