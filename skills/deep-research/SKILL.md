# Gemini Deep Research Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/deep-research` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Gemini Deep Research Skill Run autonomous research tasks that plan, search, read, and synthesize information into comprehensive reports.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Requirements, Output Formats, Cost & Time, Best Use Cases, Exit Codes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Performing market analysis
- Conducting competitive landscaping
- Creating literature reviews
- Doing technical research
- Performing due diligence
- Need detailed, cited research reports

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. Set the environment variable:
3. User requests research → Run --query "..."
4. Inform user of estimated time (2-10 minutes)
5. Monitor with --stream or poll with --status
6. Return formatted results
7. Use --continue for follow-up questions

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file in the skill directory.

#### Imported: Workflow

1. User requests research → Run `--query "..."`
2. Inform user of estimated time (2-10 minutes)
3. Monitor with `--stream` or poll with `--status`
4. Return formatted results
5. Use `--continue` for follow-up questions

#### Imported: Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- httpx: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @deep-research to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/deep-research/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/deep-research/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @deep-research using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Usage

### Start a research task
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research the history of Kubernetes"
```

### With structured output format
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Compare Python web frameworks" \
  --format "1. Executive Summary\n2. Comparison Table\n3. Recommendations"
```

### Stream progress in real-time
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Analyze EV battery market" --stream
```

### Start without waiting
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research topic" --no-wait
```

### Check status of running research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --status <interaction_id>
```

### Wait for completion
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --wait <interaction_id>
```

### Continue from previous research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Elaborate on point 2" --continue <interaction_id>
```

### List recent research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --list
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/deep-research`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
