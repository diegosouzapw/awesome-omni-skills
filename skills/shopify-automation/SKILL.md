# Shopify Automation via Rube MCP

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/shopify-automation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Shopify Automation via Rube MCP Automate Shopify operations through Composio's Shopify toolkit via Rube MCP.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Common Patterns, Known Pitfalls, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Automate Shopify tasks via Rube MCP (Composio): products, orders, customers, inventory, collections. Always search tools first for current schemas.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming RUBESEARCHTOOLS responds
2. Call RUBEMANAGECONNECTIONS with toolkit shopify
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Shopify OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows
5. SHOPIFYGETPRODUCTS / SHOPIFYGETPRODUCTS_PAGINATED - List products [Optional]
6. SHOPIFYGETPRODUCT - Get single product details [Optional]
7. SHOPIFYBULKCREATE_PRODUCTS - Create products in bulk [Optional]

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `shopify`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Shopify OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

#### Imported: Core Workflows

### 1. Manage Products

**When to use**: User wants to list, search, create, or manage products

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS` / `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_PAGINATED` - List products [Optional]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCT` - Get single product details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_BULK_CREATE_PRODUCTS` - Create products in bulk [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_COUNT` - Get product count [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `product_id`: Product ID for single retrieval
- `title`: Product title
- `vendor`: Product vendor
- `status`: 'active', 'draft', or 'archived'

**Pitfalls**:
- Paginated results require cursor-based pagination for large catalogs
- Product variants are nested within the product object

### 2. Manage Orders

**When to use**: User wants to list, search, or inspect orders

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_ORDERS_WITH_FILTERS` - List orders with filters [Required]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_ORDER` - Get single order details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_GET_FULFILLMENT` - Get fulfillment details [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_GET_FULFILLMENT_EVENTS` - Track fulfillment events [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `status`: Order status filter ('any', 'open', 'closed', 'cancelled')
- `financial_status`: Payment status filter
- `fulfillment_status`: Fulfillment status filter
- `order_id`: Order ID for single retrieval
- `created_at_min`/`created_at_max`: Date range filters

**Pitfalls**:
- Order IDs are numeric; use string format for API calls
- Default order listing may not include all statuses; specify 'any' for all

### 3. Manage Customers

**When to use**: User wants to list or search customers

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_ALL_CUSTOMERS` - List all customers [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `limit`: Number of customers per page
- `since_id`: Pagination cursor

**Pitfalls**:
- Customer data includes order count and total spent
- Large customer lists require pagination

### 4. Manage Collections

**When to use**: User wants to manage product collections

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_SMART_COLLECTIONS` - List smart collections [Optional]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_SMART_COLLECTION_BY_ID` - Get collection details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_CREATE_SMART_COLLECTIONS` - Create a smart collection [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_ADD_PRODUCT_TO_COLLECTION` - Add product to collection [Optional]
5. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_IN_COLLECTION` - List products in collection [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `collection_id`: Collection ID
- `product_id`: Product ID for adding to collection
- `rules`: Smart collection rules for automatic inclusion

**Pitfalls**:
- Smart collections auto-populate based on rules; manual collections use custom collections API
- Collection count endpoints provide approximate counts

### 5. Manage Inventory

**When to use**: User wants to check or manage inventory levels

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_INVENTORY_LEVELS` / `SHOPIFY_RETRIEVES_A_LIST_OF_INVENTORY_LEVELS` - Check stock [Required]
2. `SHOPIFY_LIST_LOCATION` - List store locations [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `inventory_item_ids`: Inventory item IDs to check
- `location_ids`: Location IDs to filter by

**Pitfalls**:
- Inventory is tracked per variant per location
- Location IDs are required for multi-location stores

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Shopify connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `shopify`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @shopify-automation to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @shopify-automation against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @shopify-automation for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @shopify-automation using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/shopify-automation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.



## Related Skills

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### Pagination

- Use `limit` and `page_info` cursor for paginated results
- Check response for `next` link header
- Continue until no more pages available

### GraphQL Queries

For advanced operations:
```
1. Call SHOPIFY_GRAPH_QL_QUERY with custom query
2. Parse response from data object
```

#### Imported: Known Pitfalls

**API Versioning**:
- Shopify REST API has versioned endpoints
- Some features require specific API versions

**Rate Limits**:
- REST API: 2 requests/second for standard plans
- GraphQL: 1000 cost points per second

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
