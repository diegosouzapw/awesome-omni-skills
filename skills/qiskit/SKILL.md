# Qiskit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/qiskit` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Qiskit

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Common Patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You are building or optimizing quantum circuits with Qiskit for simulators or real hardware.
- You need IBM Quantum-style tooling for transpilation, execution, visualization, or algorithm libraries.
- You want guidance on moving from a simple circuit prototype to backend-aware execution.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Qiskit is the world's most popular open-source quantum computing framework with 13M+ downloads. Build quantum circuits, optimize for hardware, execute on simulators or real quantum computers, and analyze results.....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @qiskit to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/qiskit/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/qiskit/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @qiskit using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
uv pip install qiskit
uv pip install "qiskit[visualization]" matplotlib
```

### First Circuit

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler

# Create Bell state (entangled qubits)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)           # Hadamard on qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)       # CNOT from qubit 0 to 1
qc.measure_all()  # Measure both qubits

# Run locally
sampler = StatevectorSampler()
result = sampler.run([qc], shots=1024).result()
counts = result[0].data.meas.get_counts()
print(counts)  # {'00': ~512, '11': ~512}
```

### Visualization

```python
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

qc.draw('mpl')           # Circuit diagram
plot_histogram(counts)   # Results histogram
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Start with simulators: Test locally before using hardware
- Always transpile: Optimize circuits before execution
- Use appropriate primitives:
- Sampler for bitstrings (optimization algorithms)
- Estimator for expectation values (chemistry, physics)
- Choose execution mode:
- Session: Iterative algorithms (VQE, QAOA)

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with simulators**: Test locally before using hardware
   ```python
   from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler
   sampler = StatevectorSampler()
   ```

2. **Always transpile**: Optimize circuits before execution
   ```python
   from qiskit import transpile
   qc_optimized = transpile(qc, backend=backend, optimization_level=3)
   ```

3. **Use appropriate primitives**:
   - Sampler for bitstrings (optimization algorithms)
   - Estimator for expectation values (chemistry, physics)

4. **Choose execution mode**:
   - Session: Iterative algorithms (VQE, QAOA)
   - Batch: Independent parallel jobs
   - Single job: One-off experiments

### Performance Optimization

- Use optimization_level=3 for production
- Minimize two-qubit gates (major error source)
- Test with noisy simulators before hardware
- Save and reuse transpiled circuits
- Monitor convergence in variational algorithms

### Hardware Execution

- Check backend status before submitting
- Use least_busy() for testing
- Save job IDs for later retrieval
- Apply error mitigation (resilience_level)
- Start with fewer shots, increase for final runs

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/qiskit`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler
from qiskit import transpile

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibm_brisbane")

qc_optimized = transpile(qc, backend=backend, optimization_level=3)

sampler = Sampler(backend)
job = sampler.run([qc_optimized], shots=1024)
result = job.result()
```

### Pattern 3: Variational Algorithm (VQE)

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, EstimatorV2 as Estimator
from scipy.optimize import minimize

with Session(backend=backend) as session:
    estimator = Estimator(session=session)

    def cost_function(params):
        bound_qc = ansatz.assign_parameters(params)
        qc_isa = transpile(bound_qc, backend=backend)
        result = estimator.run([(qc_isa, hamiltonian)]).result()
        return result[0].data.evs

    result = minimize(cost_function, initial_params, method='COBYLA')
```
