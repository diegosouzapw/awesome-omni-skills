# Node.js Best Practices

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/nodejs-best-practices` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Node.js Best Practices > Principles and decision-making for Node.js development in 2025. > Learn to THINK, not memorize code patterns.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill, 1. Framework Selection (2025), 2. Runtime Considerations (2025), 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid, 11. Decision Checklist, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use this skill when making Node.js architecture decisions, choosing frameworks, designing async patterns, or applying security and deployment best practices.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Node.js development principles and decision-making. Framework selection, async patterns, security, and architecture. Teaches thinking, not copying.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **decision-making principles**, not fixed code to copy.

- ASK user for preferences when unclear
- Choose framework/pattern based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to same solution every time

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @nodejs-best-practices to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @nodejs-best-practices against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @nodejs-best-practices for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @nodejs-best-practices using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Testability: Mock layers independently
- Flexibility: Swap database without touching business logic
- Clarity: Each layer has single responsibility
- Small scripts → Single file OK
- Prototypes → Less structure acceptable
- Always ask: "Will this grow?"
- Situation - Status - When

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: 3. Architecture Principles

### Layered Structure Concept

```
Request Flow:
│
├── Controller/Route Layer
│   ├── Handles HTTP specifics
│   ├── Input validation at boundary
│   └── Calls service layer
│
├── Service Layer
│   ├── Business logic
│   ├── Framework-agnostic
│   └── Calls repository layer
│
└── Repository Layer
    ├── Data access only
    ├── Database queries
    └── ORM interactions
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Testability**: Mock layers independently
- **Flexibility**: Swap database without touching business logic
- **Clarity**: Each layer has single responsibility

### When to Simplify:
- Small scripts → Single file OK
- Prototypes → Less structure acceptable
- Always ask: "Will this grow?"

#### Imported: 4. Error Handling Principles

### Centralized Error Handling

```
Pattern:
├── Create custom error classes
├── Throw from any layer
├── Catch at top level (middleware)
└── Format consistent response
```

### Error Response Philosophy

```
Client gets:
├── Appropriate HTTP status
├── Error code for programmatic handling
├── User-friendly message
└── NO internal details (security!)

Logs get:
├── Full stack trace
├── Request context
├── User ID (if applicable)
└── Timestamp
```

### Status Code Selection

| Situation | Status | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Bad input | 400 | Client sent invalid data |
| No auth | 401 | Missing or invalid credentials |
| No permission | 403 | Valid auth, but not allowed |
| Not found | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |
| Conflict | 409 | Duplicate or state conflict |
| Validation | 422 | Schema valid but business rules fail |
| Server error | 500 | Our fault, log everything |

---

#### Imported: 5. Async Patterns Principles

### When to Use Each

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `async/await` | Sequential async operations |
| `Promise.all` | Parallel independent operations |
| `Promise.allSettled` | Parallel where some can fail |
| `Promise.race` | Timeout or first response wins |

### Event Loop Awareness

```
I/O-bound (async helps):
├── Database queries
├── HTTP requests
├── File system
└── Network operations

CPU-bound (async doesn't help):
├── Crypto operations
├── Image processing
├── Complex calculations
└── → Use worker threads or offload
```

### Avoiding Event Loop Blocking

- Never use sync methods in production (fs.readFileSync, etc.)
- Offload CPU-intensive work
- Use streaming for large data

---

#### Imported: 6. Validation Principles

### Validate at Boundaries

```
Where to validate:
├── API entry point (request body/params)
├── Before database operations
├── External data (API responses, file uploads)
└── Environment variables (startup)
```

### Validation Library Selection

| Library | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Zod** | TypeScript first, inference |
| **Valibot** | Smaller bundle (tree-shakeable) |
| **ArkType** | Performance critical |
| **Yup** | Existing React Form usage |

### Validation Philosophy

- Fail fast: Validate early
- Be specific: Clear error messages
- Don't trust: Even "internal" data

---

#### Imported: 7. Security Principles

### Security Checklist (Not Code)

- [ ] **Input validation**: All inputs validated
- [ ] **Parameterized queries**: No string concatenation for SQL
- [ ] **Password hashing**: bcrypt or argon2
- [ ] **JWT verification**: Always verify signature and expiry
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Protect from abuse
- [ ] **Security headers**: Helmet.js or equivalent
- [ ] **HTTPS**: Everywhere in production
- [ ] **CORS**: Properly configured
- [ ] **Secrets**: Environment variables only
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Regularly audited

### Security Mindset

```
Trust nothing:
├── Query params → validate
├── Request body → validate
├── Headers → verify
├── Cookies → validate
├── File uploads → scan
└── External APIs → validate response
```

---

#### Imported: 8. Testing Principles

### Test Strategy Selection

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Unit** | Business logic | node:test, Vitest |
| **Integration** | API endpoints | Supertest |
| **E2E** | Full flows | Playwright |

### What to Test (Priorities)

1. **Critical paths**: Auth, payments, core business
2. **Edge cases**: Empty inputs, boundaries
3. **Error handling**: What happens when things fail?
4. **Not worth testing**: Framework code, trivial getters

### Built-in Test Runner (Node.js 22+)

```
node --test src/**/*.test.ts
├── No external dependency
├── Good coverage reporting
└── Watch mode available
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/nodejs-best-practices`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.



## Related Skills

- `@monte-carlo-monitor-creation` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@monte-carlo-prevent` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@monte-carlo-push-ingestion` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@monte-carlo-validation-notebook` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: 1. Framework Selection (2025)

### Decision Tree

```
What are you building?
│
├── Edge/Serverless (Cloudflare, Vercel)
│   └── Hono (zero-dependency, ultra-fast cold starts)
│
├── High Performance API
│   └── Fastify (2-3x faster than Express)
│
├── Enterprise/Team familiarity
│   └── NestJS (structured, DI, decorators)
│
├── Legacy/Stable/Maximum ecosystem
│   └── Express (mature, most middleware)
│
└── Full-stack with frontend
    └── Next.js API Routes or tRPC
```

### Comparison Principles

| Factor | Hono | Fastify | Express |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **Best for** | Edge, serverless | Performance | Legacy, learning |
| **Cold start** | Fastest | Fast | Moderate |
| **Ecosystem** | Growing | Good | Largest |
| **TypeScript** | Native | Excellent | Good |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | Low |

### Selection Questions to Ask:
1. What's the deployment target?
2. Is cold start time critical?
3. Does team have existing experience?
4. Is there legacy code to maintain?

#### Imported: 2. Runtime Considerations (2025)

### Native TypeScript

```
Node.js 22+: --experimental-strip-types
├── Run .ts files directly
├── No build step needed for simple projects
└── Consider for: scripts, simple APIs
```

### Module System Decision

```
ESM (import/export)
├── Modern standard
├── Better tree-shaking
├── Async module loading
└── Use for: new projects

CommonJS (require)
├── Legacy compatibility
├── More npm packages support
└── Use for: existing codebases, some edge cases
```

### Runtime Selection

| Runtime | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Node.js** | General purpose, largest ecosystem |
| **Bun** | Performance, built-in bundler |
| **Deno** | Security-first, built-in TypeScript |

---

#### Imported: 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use Express for new edge projects (use Hono)
- Use sync methods in production code
- Put business logic in controllers
- Skip input validation
- Hardcode secrets
- Trust external data without validation
- Block event loop with CPU work

### ✅ DO:
- Choose framework based on context
- Ask user for preferences when unclear
- Use layered architecture for growing projects
- Validate all inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Profile before optimizing

---

#### Imported: 11. Decision Checklist

Before implementing:

- [ ] **Asked user about stack preference?**
- [ ] **Chosen framework for THIS context?** (not just default)
- [ ] **Considered deployment target?**
- [ ] **Planned error handling strategy?**
- [ ] **Identified validation points?**
- [ ] **Considered security requirements?**

---

> **Remember**: Node.js best practices are about decision-making, not memorizing patterns. Every project deserves fresh consideration based on its requirements.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
