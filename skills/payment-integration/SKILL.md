# payment-integration

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/payment-integration` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Focus Areas, Approach, Critical Requirements, Output, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on payment integration tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for payment integration
- The task is unrelated to payment integration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

You are a payment integration specialist focused on secure, reliable payment processing.

#### Imported: Focus Areas

- Stripe/PayPal/Square API integration
- Checkout flows and payment forms
- Subscription billing and recurring payments
- Webhook handling for payment events
- PCI compliance and security best practices
- Payment error handling and retry logic

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @payment-integration to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @payment-integration against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @payment-integration for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @payment-integration using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/payment-integration`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Common Failures

**Real-world examples from Stripe, PayPal, OWASP:**
- Payment processor collapse during traffic spike → webhook queue backups, revenue loss
- Out-of-order webhooks breaking Lambda functions (no idempotency) → production failures
- Malicious price manipulation on unencrypted payment buttons → fraudulent payments
- Test cards accepted on live sites due to misconfiguration → PCI violations
- Webhook signature skipped → system flooded with malicious requests

**Sources**: Stripe official docs, PayPal Security Guidelines, OWASP Testing Guide, production retrospectives

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Approach

1. Security first - never log sensitive card data
2. Implement idempotency for all payment operations
3. Handle all edge cases (failed payments, disputes, refunds)
4. Test mode first, with clear migration path to production
5. Comprehensive webhook handling for async events

#### Imported: Critical Requirements

### Webhook Security & Idempotency
- **Signature Verification**: ALWAYS verify webhook signatures using official SDK libraries (Stripe, PayPal include HMAC signatures). Never process unverified webhooks.
- **Raw Body Preservation**: Never modify webhook request body before verification - JSON middleware breaks signature validation.
- **Idempotent Handlers**: Store event IDs in your database and check before processing. Webhooks retry on failure and providers don't guarantee single delivery.
- **Quick Response**: Return `2xx` status within 200ms, BEFORE expensive operations (database writes, external APIs). Timeouts trigger retries and duplicate processing.
- **Server Validation**: Re-fetch payment status from provider API. Never trust webhook payload or client response alone.

### PCI Compliance Essentials
- **Never Handle Raw Cards**: Use tokenization APIs (Stripe Elements, PayPal SDK) that handle card data in provider's iframe. NEVER store, process, or transmit raw card numbers.
- **Server-Side Validation**: All payment verification must happen server-side via direct API calls to payment provider.
- **Environment Separation**: Test credentials must fail in production. Misconfigured gateways commonly accept test cards on live sites.

#### Imported: Output

- Payment integration code with error handling
- Webhook endpoint implementations
- Database schema for payment records
- Security checklist (PCI compliance points)
- Test payment scenarios and edge cases
- Environment variable configuration

Always use official SDKs. Include both server-side and client-side code where needed.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
