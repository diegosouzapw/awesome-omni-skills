# Web3 Smart Contract Testing

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/web3-testing` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Web3 Smart Contract Testing Master comprehensive testing strategies for smart contracts using Hardhat, Foundry, and advanced testing patterns.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Unit Testing Patterns, Foundry Testing (Forge), Advanced Testing Patterns, Gas Optimization Testing, Coverage Reporting, Contract Verification.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to web3 smart contract testing
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Writing unit tests for smart contracts
- Setting up integration test suites
- Performing gas optimization testing
- Fuzzing for edge cases

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

#### Imported: Unit Testing Patterns

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const {
  loadFixture,
  time,
} = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

describe("Token Contract", function () {
  // Fixture for test setup
  async function deployTokenFixture() {
    const [owner, addr1, addr2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("Token");
    const token = await Token.deploy();

    return { token, owner, addr1, addr2 };
  }

  describe("Deployment", function () {
    it("Should set the right owner", async function () {
      const { token, owner } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);
      expect(await token.owner()).to.equal(owner.address);
    });

    it("Should assign total supply to owner", async function () {
      const { token, owner } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);
      const ownerBalance = await token.balanceOf(owner.address);
      expect(await token.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);
    });
  });

  describe("Transactions", function () {
    it("Should transfer tokens between accounts", async function () {
      const { token, owner, addr1 } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);

      await expect(token.transfer(addr1.address, 50)).to.changeTokenBalances(
        token,
        [owner, addr1],
        [-50, 50],
      );
    });

    it("Should fail if sender doesn't have enough tokens", async function () {
      const { token, addr1 } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);
      const initialBalance = await token.balanceOf(addr1.address);

      await expect(
        token.connect(addr1).transfer(owner.address, 1),
      ).to.be.revertedWith("Insufficient balance");
    });

    it("Should emit Transfer event", async function () {
      const { token, owner, addr1 } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);

      await expect(token.transfer(addr1.address, 50))
        .to.emit(token, "Transfer")
        .withArgs(owner.address, addr1.address, 50);
    });
  });

  describe("Time-based tests", function () {
    it("Should handle time-locked operations", async function () {
      const { token } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);

      // Increase time by 1 day
      await time.increase(86400);

      // Test time-dependent functionality
    });
  });

  describe("Gas optimization", function () {
    it("Should use gas efficiently", async function () {
      const { token } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture);

      const tx = await token.transfer(addr1.address, 100);
      const receipt = await tx.wait();

      expect(receipt.gasUsed).to.be.lessThan(50000);
    });
  });
});
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @web3-testing to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @web3-testing against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @web3-testing for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @web3-testing using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Test Coverage: Aim for >90% coverage
- Edge Cases: Test boundary conditions
- Gas Limits: Verify functions don't hit block gas limit
- Reentrancy: Test for reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access Control: Test unauthorized access attempts
- Events: Verify event emissions
- Fixtures: Use fixtures to avoid code duplication

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/web3-testing`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
