# Image Optimization Analysis

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/seo-images` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Image Optimization Analysis

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Checks, Output, Error Handling, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when auditing image SEO, alt text, file sizes, formats, or lazy loading.
- Use when the user wants image-specific performance recommendations.
- Use when checking media quality signals that affect both SEO and Core Web Vitals.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: >.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Checks

### Alt Text
- Present on all `<img>` elements (except decorative: `role="presentation"`)
- Descriptive: describes the image content, not "image.jpg" or "photo"
- Includes relevant keywords where natural, not keyword-stuffed
- Length: 10-125 characters

**Good examples:**
- "Professional plumber repairing kitchen sink faucet"
- "Red 2024 Toyota Camry sedan front view"
- "Team meeting in modern office conference room"

**Bad examples:**
- "image.jpg" (filename, not description)
- "plumber plumbing plumber services" (keyword stuffing)
- "Click here" (not descriptive)

### File Size

**Tiered thresholds by image category:**

| Image Category | Target | Warning | Critical |
|----------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Thumbnails | < 50KB | > 100KB | > 200KB |
| Content images | < 100KB | > 200KB | > 500KB |
| Hero/banner images | < 200KB | > 300KB | > 700KB |

Recommend compression to target thresholds where possible without quality loss.

### Format
| Format | Browser Support | Use Case |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| WebP | 97%+ | Default recommendation |
| AVIF | 92%+ | Best compression, newer |
| JPEG | 100% | Fallback for photos |
| PNG | 100% | Graphics with transparency |
| SVG | 100% | Icons, logos, illustrations |

Recommend WebP/AVIF over JPEG/PNG. Check for `<picture>` element with format fallbacks.

#### Recommended `<picture>` Element Pattern

Use progressive enhancement with the most efficient format first:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
</picture>
```

The browser will use the first supported format. Current browser support: AVIF 93.8%, WebP 95.3%.

#### JPEG XL: Emerging Format

In November 2025, Google's Chromium team reversed its 2022 decision and announced it will restore JPEG XL support in Chrome using a Rust-based decoder. The implementation is feature-complete but not yet in Chrome stable. JPEG XL offers lossless JPEG recompression (~20% savings with zero quality loss) and competitive lossy compression. Not yet practical for web deployment, but worth monitoring for future adoption.

### Responsive Images
- `srcset` attribute for multiple sizes
- `sizes` attribute matching layout breakpoints
- Appropriate resolution for device pixel ratios

```html
<img
  src="image-800.jpg"
  srcset="image-400.jpg 400w, image-800.jpg 800w, image-1200.jpg 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"
  alt="Description"
>
```

### Lazy Loading
- `loading="lazy"` on below-fold images
- Do NOT lazy-load above-fold/hero images (hurts LCP)
- Check for native vs JavaScript-based lazy loading

```html
<!-- Below fold - lazy load -->
<img src="photo.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description">

<!-- Above fold - eager load (default) -->
<img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero image">
```

### `fetchpriority="high"` for LCP Images

Add `fetchpriority="high"` to your hero/LCP image to prioritize its download in the browser's network queue:

```html
<img src="hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" alt="Hero image description" width="1200" height="630">
```

**Critical:** Do NOT lazy-load above-the-fold/LCP images. Using `loading="lazy"` on LCP images directly harms LCP scores. Reserve `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold images only.

### `decoding="async"` for Non-LCP Images

Add `decoding="async"` to non-LCP images to prevent image decoding from blocking the main thread:

```html
<img src="photo.webp" alt="Description" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
```

### CLS Prevention
- `width` and `height` attributes set on all `<img>` elements
- `aspect-ratio` CSS as alternative
- Flag images without dimensions

```html
<!-- Good - dimensions set -->
<img src="photo.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Description">

<!-- Good - CSS aspect ratio -->
<img src="photo.jpg" style="aspect-ratio: 4/3" alt="Description">

<!-- Bad - no dimensions -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description">
```

### File Names
- Descriptive: `blue-running-shoes.webp` not `IMG_1234.jpg`
- Hyphenated, lowercase, no special characters
- Include relevant keywords

### CDN Usage
- Check if images served from CDN (different domain, CDN headers)
- Recommend CDN for image-heavy sites
- Check for edge caching headers

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @seo-images-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/seo-images-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/seo-images-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @seo-images-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/seo-images`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Output

### Image Audit Summary

| Metric | Status | Count |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total Images | - | XX |
| Missing Alt Text | ❌ | XX |
| Oversized (>200KB) | ⚠️ | XX |
| Wrong Format | ⚠️ | XX |
| No Dimensions | ⚠️ | XX |
| Not Lazy Loaded | ⚠️ | XX |

### Prioritized Optimization List

Sorted by file size impact (largest savings first):

| Image | Current Size | Format | Issues | Est. Savings |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Recommendations
1. Convert X images to WebP format (est. XX KB savings)
2. Add alt text to X images
3. Add dimensions to X images
4. Enable lazy loading on X below-fold images
5. Compress X oversized images

#### Imported: Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| URL unreachable | Report connection error with status code. Suggest verifying URL and checking if site requires authentication. |
| No images found on page | Report that no `<img>` elements were detected. Suggest checking if images are loaded via JavaScript or CSS background-image. |
| Images behind CDN or authentication | Note that image files could not be directly accessed for size analysis. Report available metadata (alt text, dimensions, format from markup) and flag inaccessible resources. |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
