# fixing-metadata

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/fixing-metadata` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: review guidance, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- adding or changing page titles, descriptions, canonical, robots
- implementing Open Graph or Twitter card metadata
- setting favicons, app icons, manifest, theme-color
- building shared SEO components or layout metadata defaults
- adding structured data (JSON-LD)
- changing locale, alternate languages, or canonical routing

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Identify pages with missing or incorrect metadata (titles, descriptions, canonical, OG tags)
2. Audit against the priority rules below — fix critical issues (duplicates, indexing) first
3. Ensure title, description, canonical, and og:url all agree with each other
4. Verify social cards render correctly on a real URL, not localhost
5. Keep diffs minimal and scoped to metadata only — do not refactor unrelated code
6. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
7. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.

### Imported Workflow Notes

2. Audit against the priority rules below — fix critical issues (duplicates, indexing) first
3. Ensure title, description, canonical, and og:url all agree with each other

5. Keep diffs minimal and scoped to metadata only — do not refactor unrelated code

#### Imported: review guidance

- fix critical issues first (duplicates, canonical, indexing)
- ensure title, description, canonical, and og:url agree
- verify social cards on a real URL, not localhost
- prefer stable, boring metadata over clever or dynamic
- keep diffs minimal and scoped to metadata only

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @fixing-metadata to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @fixing-metadata against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @fixing-metadata for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @fixing-metadata using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- priority - category - impact
- 1 - correctness and duplication - critical
- 2 - title and description - high
- 3 - canonical and indexing - high
- 4 - social cards - high
- 5 - icons and manifest - medium
- 6 - structured data - medium

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/fixing-metadata`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: quick reference

### 1. correctness and duplication (critical)

- define metadata in one place per page, avoid competing systems
- do not emit duplicate title, description, canonical, or robots tags
- metadata must be deterministic, no random or unstable values
- escape and sanitize any user-generated or dynamic strings
- every page must have safe defaults for title and description

### 2. title and description (high)

- every page must have a title
- use a consistent title format across the site
- keep titles short and readable, avoid stuffing
- shareable or searchable pages should have a meta description
- descriptions must be plain text, no markdown or quote spam

### 3. canonical and indexing (high)

- canonical must point to the preferred URL for the page
- use noindex only for private, duplicate, or non-public pages
- robots meta must match actual access intent
- previews or staging pages should be noindex by default when possible
- paginated pages must have correct canonical behavior

### 4. social cards (high)

- shareable pages must set Open Graph title, description, and image
- Open Graph and Twitter images must use absolute URLs
- prefer correct image dimensions and stable aspect ratios
- og:url must match the canonical URL
- use a sensible og:type, usually website or article
- set twitter:card appropriately, summary_large_image by default

### 5. icons and manifest (medium)

- include at least one favicon that works across browsers
- include apple-touch-icon when relevant
- manifest must be valid and referenced when used
- set theme-color intentionally to avoid mismatched UI chrome
- icon paths should be stable and cacheable

### 6. structured data (medium)

- do not add JSON-LD unless it clearly maps to real page content
- JSON-LD must be valid and reflect what is actually rendered
- do not invent ratings, reviews, prices, or organization details
- prefer one structured data block per page unless required

### 7. locale and alternates (low-medium)

- set the html lang attribute correctly
- set og:locale when localization exists
- add hreflang alternates only when pages truly exist
- localized pages must canonicalize correctly per locale

### 8. tool boundaries (critical)

- prefer minimal changes, do not refactor unrelated code
- do not migrate frameworks or SEO libraries unless requested
- follow the project's existing metadata pattern (Next.js metadata API, react-helmet, manual head, etc.)

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
