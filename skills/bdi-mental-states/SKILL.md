# BDI Mental State Modeling

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/bdi-mental-states` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# BDI Mental State Modeling Transform external RDF context into agent mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) using formal BDI ontology patterns. This skill enables agents to reason about context through cognitive architecture, supporting deliberative reasoning, explainability, and semantic interoperability within multi-agent systems.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Concepts, T2B2T Paradigm, Notation Selection by Level, Justification and Explainability, Temporal Dimensions, Compositional Mental Entities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Processing external RDF context into agent beliefs about world states
- Modeling rational agency with perception, deliberation, and action cycles
- Enabling explainability through traceable reasoning chains
- Implementing BDI frameworks (SEMAS, JADE, JADEX)
- Augmenting LLMs with formal cognitive structures (Logic Augmented Generation)
- Coordinating mental states across multi-agent platforms

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Concepts

### Mental Reality Architecture

**Mental States (Endurants)**: Persistent cognitive attributes
- `Belief`: What the agent believes to be true about the world
- `Desire`: What the agent wishes to bring about
- `Intention`: What the agent commits to achieving

**Mental Processes (Perdurants)**: Events that modify mental states
- `BeliefProcess`: Forming/updating beliefs from perception
- `DesireProcess`: Generating desires from beliefs
- `IntentionProcess`: Committing to desires as actionable intentions

### Cognitive Chain Pattern

```turtle
:Belief_store_open a bdi:Belief ;
    rdfs:comment "Store is open" ;
    bdi:motivates :Desire_buy_groceries .

:Desire_buy_groceries a bdi:Desire ;
    rdfs:comment "I desire to buy groceries" ;
    bdi:isMotivatedBy :Belief_store_open .

:Intention_go_shopping a bdi:Intention ;
    rdfs:comment "I will buy groceries" ;
    bdi:fulfils :Desire_buy_groceries ;
    bdi:isSupportedBy :Belief_store_open ;
    bdi:specifies :Plan_shopping .
```

### World State Grounding

Mental states reference structured configurations of the environment:

```turtle
:Agent_A a bdi:Agent ;
    bdi:perceives :WorldState_WS1 ;
    bdi:hasMentalState :Belief_B1 .

:WorldState_WS1 a bdi:WorldState ;
    rdfs:comment "Meeting scheduled at 10am in Room 5" ;
    bdi:atTime :TimeInstant_10am .

:Belief_B1 a bdi:Belief ;
    bdi:refersTo :WorldState_WS1 .
```

### Goal-Directed Planning

Intentions specify plans that address goals through task sequences:

```turtle
:Intention_I1 bdi:specifies :Plan_P1 .

:Plan_P1 a bdi:Plan ;
    bdi:addresses :Goal_G1 ;
    bdi:beginsWith :Task_T1 ;
    bdi:endsWith :Task_T3 .

:Task_T1 bdi:precedes :Task_T2 .
:Task_T2 bdi:precedes :Task_T3 .
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @bdi-mental-states to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/bdi-mental-states/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/bdi-mental-states/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @bdi-mental-states using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Model world states as configurations independent of agent perspectives, providing referential substrate for mental states.
- Distinguish endurants (persistent mental states) from perdurants (temporal mental processes), aligning with DOLCE ontology.
- Treat goals as descriptions rather than mental states, maintaining separation between cognitive and planning layers.
- Use hasPart relations for meronymic structures enabling selective belief updates.
- Associate every mental entity with temporal constructs via atTime or hasValidity.
- Use bidirectional property pairs (motivates/isMotivatedBy, generates/isGeneratedBy) for flexible querying.
- Link mental entities to Justification instances for explainability and trust.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Guidelines

1. Model world states as configurations independent of agent perspectives, providing referential substrate for mental states.

2. Distinguish endurants (persistent mental states) from perdurants (temporal mental processes), aligning with DOLCE ontology.

3. Treat goals as descriptions rather than mental states, maintaining separation between cognitive and planning layers.

4. Use `hasPart` relations for meronymic structures enabling selective belief updates.

5. Associate every mental entity with temporal constructs via `atTime` or `hasValidity`.

6. Use bidirectional property pairs (`motivates`/`isMotivatedBy`, `generates`/`isGeneratedBy`) for flexible querying.

7. Link mental entities to `Justification` instances for explainability and trust.

8. Implement T2B2T through: (1) translate RDF to beliefs, (2) execute BDI reasoning, (3) project mental states back to RDF.

9. Define existential restrictions on mental processes (e.g., `BeliefProcess ⊑ ∃generates.Belief`).

10. Reuse established ODPs (EventCore, Situation, TimeIndexedSituation, BasicPlan, Provenance) for interoperability.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/bdi-mental-states`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

| L3 Component | UML | Mental state managers, process handlers |
| L4 Code | UML/RDF | Belief/Desire/Intention classes, ontology instances |

#### Imported: Justification and Explainability

Mental entities link to supporting evidence for traceable reasoning:

```turtle
:Belief_B1 a bdi:Belief ;
    bdi:isJustifiedBy :Justification_J1 .

:Justification_J1 a bdi:Justification ;
    rdfs:comment "Official announcement received via email" .

:Intention_I1 a bdi:Intention ;
    bdi:isJustifiedBy :Justification_J2 .

:Justification_J2 a bdi:Justification ;
    rdfs:comment "Location precondition satisfied" .
```

#### Imported: Temporal Dimensions

Mental states persist over bounded time periods:

```turtle
:Belief_B1 a bdi:Belief ;
    bdi:hasValidity :TimeInterval_TI1 .

:TimeInterval_TI1 a bdi:TimeInterval ;
    bdi:hasStartTime :TimeInstant_9am ;
    bdi:hasEndTime :TimeInstant_11am .
```

Query mental states active at specific moments:

```sparql
SELECT ?mentalState WHERE {
    ?mentalState bdi:hasValidity ?interval .
    ?interval bdi:hasStartTime ?start ;
              bdi:hasEndTime ?end .
    FILTER(?start <= "2025-01-04T10:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime && 
           ?end >= "2025-01-04T10:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
```

#### Imported: Compositional Mental Entities

Complex mental entities decompose into constituent parts for selective updates:

```turtle
:Belief_meeting a bdi:Belief ;
    rdfs:comment "Meeting at 10am in Room 5" ;
    bdi:hasPart :Belief_meeting_time , :Belief_meeting_location .

# Update only location component
:BeliefProcess_update a bdi:BeliefProcess ;
    bdi:modifies :Belief_meeting_location .
```

#### Imported: Integration Patterns

### Logic Augmented Generation (LAG)

Augment LLM outputs with ontological constraints:

```python
def augment_llm_with_bdi_ontology(prompt, ontology_graph):
    ontology_context = serialize_ontology(ontology_graph, format='turtle')
    augmented_prompt = f"{ontology_context}\n\n{prompt}"
    
    response = llm.generate(augmented_prompt)
    triples = extract_rdf_triples(response)
    
    is_consistent = validate_triples(triples, ontology_graph)
    return triples if is_consistent else retry_with_feedback()
```

### SEMAS Rule Translation

Map BDI ontology to executable production rules:

```prolog
% Belief triggers desire formation
[HEAD: belief(agent_a, store_open)] / 
[CONDITIONALS: time(weekday_afternoon)] » 
[TAIL: generate_desire(agent_a, buy_groceries)].

% Desire triggers intention commitment
[HEAD: desire(agent_a, buy_groceries)] / 
[CONDITIONALS: belief(agent_a, has_shopping_list)] » 
[TAIL: commit_intention(agent_a, buy_groceries)].
```

#### Imported: Competency Questions

Validate implementation against these SPARQL queries:

```sparql
# CQ1: What beliefs motivated formation of a given desire?
SELECT ?belief WHERE {
    :Desire_D1 bdi:isMotivatedBy ?belief .
}

# CQ2: Which desire does a particular intention fulfill?
SELECT ?desire WHERE {
    :Intention_I1 bdi:fulfils ?desire .
}

# CQ3: Which mental process generated a belief?
SELECT ?process WHERE {
    ?process bdi:generates :Belief_B1 .
}

# CQ4: What is the ordered sequence of tasks in a plan?
SELECT ?task ?nextTask WHERE {
    :Plan_P1 bdi:hasComponent ?task .
    OPTIONAL { ?task bdi:precedes ?nextTask }
} ORDER BY ?task
```

#### Imported: Anti-Patterns

1. **Conflating mental states with world states**: Mental states reference world states, they are not world states themselves.

2. **Missing temporal bounds**: Every mental state should have validity intervals for diachronic reasoning.

3. **Flat belief structures**: Use compositional modeling with `hasPart` for complex beliefs.

4. **Implicit justifications**: Always link mental entities to explicit justification instances.

5. **Direct intention-to-action mapping**: Intentions specify plans which contain tasks; actions execute tasks.

#### Imported: Integration

- **RDF Processing**: Apply after parsing external RDF context to construct cognitive representations
- **Semantic Reasoning**: Combine with ontology reasoning to infer implicit mental state relationships
- **Multi-Agent Communication**: Integrate with FIPA ACL for cross-platform belief sharing
- **Temporal Context**: Coordinate with temporal reasoning for mental state evolution
- **Explainable AI**: Feed into explanation systems tracing perception through deliberation to action
- **Neuro-Symbolic AI**: Apply in LAG pipelines to constrain LLM outputs with cognitive structures
