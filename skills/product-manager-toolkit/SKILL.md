# Product Manager Toolkit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/product-manager-toolkit` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Product Manager Toolkit Essential tools and frameworks for modern product management, from discovery to delivery.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Key Scripts, Prioritization Frameworks, Discovery Frameworks, Metrics & Analytics, Common Pitfalls to Avoid, Integration Points.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Essential tools and frameworks for modern product management, from discovery to delivery.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Gather Feature Requests
2. Customer feedback
3. Sales requests
4. Technical debt
5. Strategic initiatives
6. Score with RICE
7. Reach: Users affected per quarter

   - Use semi-structured format
   - Focus on problems, not solutions
   - Record with permission

2. **Analyze Insights**
   ```bash
   python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
   ```
   Extracts:
   - Pain points with severity
   - Feature requests with priority
   - Jobs to be done
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Key themes and quotes

3. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Group similar pain points
   - Identify patterns across interviews
   - Map to opportunity areas

4. **Validate Solutions**
   - Create solution hypotheses
   - Test with prototypes
   - Measure actual vs expected behavior

### PRD Development Process

1. **Choose Template**
   - **Standard PRD**: Complex features (6-8 weeks)
   - **One-Page PRD**: Simple features (2-4 weeks)
   - **Feature Brief**: Exploration phase (1 week)
   - **Agile Epic**: Sprint-based delivery

2. **Structure Content**
   - Problem → Solution → Success Metrics
   - Always include out-of-scope
   - Clear acceptance criteria

3. **Collaborate**
   - Engineering for feasibility
   - Design for experience
   - Sales for market validation
   - Support for operational impact

#### Imported: Key Scripts

### rice_prioritizer.py
Advanced RICE framework implementation with portfolio analysis.

**Features**:
- RICE score calculation
- Portfolio balance analysis (quick wins vs big bets)
- Quarterly roadmap generation
- Team capacity planning
- Multiple output formats (text/json/csv)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Basic prioritization
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv

# With custom team capacity (person-months per quarter)
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20

# Output as JSON for integration
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --output json
```

### customer_interview_analyzer.py
NLP-based interview analysis for extracting actionable insights.

**Capabilities**:
- Pain point extraction with severity assessment
- Feature request identification and classification
- Jobs-to-be-done pattern recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Theme extraction
- Competitor mentions
- Key quotes identification

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Analyze single interview
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py interview.txt

# Output as JSON for aggregation
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py interview.txt json
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @product-manager-toolkit to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @product-manager-toolkit using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Start with the problem, not solution
- Include clear success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Use visuals (wireframes, flows)
- Keep technical details in appendix
- Version control changes
- Mix quick wins with strategic bets

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/product-manager-toolkit`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
