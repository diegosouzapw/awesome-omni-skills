# Product Manager Toolkit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/product-manager-toolkit` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Product Manager Toolkit Essential tools and frameworks for modern product management, from discovery to delivery.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Key Scripts, Prioritization Frameworks, Discovery Frameworks, Metrics & Analytics, Common Pitfalls to Avoid, Integration Points.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Essential tools and frameworks for modern product management, from discovery to delivery.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `references/prd_templates.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Gather Feature Requests
2. Customer feedback
3. Sales requests
4. Technical debt
5. Strategic initiatives
6. Score with RICE
7. Reach: Users affected per quarter

2. **Score with RICE**
   ```bash
   # Create CSV with: name,reach,impact,confidence,effort
   python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv
   ```
   - **Reach**: Users affected per quarter
   - **Impact**: massive/high/medium/low/minimal
   - **Confidence**: high/medium/low
   - **Effort**: xl/l/m/s/xs (person-months)

3. **Analyze Portfolio**
   - Review quick wins vs big bets
   - Check effort distribution
   - Validate against strategy

4. **Generate Roadmap**
   - Quarterly capacity planning
   - Dependency mapping
   - Stakeholder alignment

### Customer Discovery Process

1. **Conduct Interviews**
   - Use semi-structured format
   - Focus on problems, not solutions
   - Record with permission

2. **Analyze Insights**
   ```bash
   python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
   ```
   Extracts:
   - Pain points with severity
   - Feature requests with priority
   - Jobs to be done
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Key themes and quotes

3. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Group similar pain points
   - Identify patterns across interviews
   - Map to opportunity areas

4. **Validate Solutions**
   - Create solution hypotheses
   - Test with prototypes
   - Measure actual vs expected behavior

### PRD Development Process

1. **Choose Template**
   - **Standard PRD**: Complex features (6-8 weeks)
   - **One-Page PRD**: Simple features (2-4 weeks)
   - **Feature Brief**: Exploration phase (1 week)
   - **Agile Epic**: Sprint-based delivery

2. **Structure Content**
   - Problem → Solution → Success Metrics
   - Always include out-of-scope
   - Clear acceptance criteria

3. **Collaborate**
   - Engineering for feasibility
   - Design for experience
   - Sales for market validation
   - Support for operational impact

#### Imported: Key Scripts

### rice_prioritizer.py
Advanced RICE framework implementation with portfolio analysis.

**Features**:
- RICE score calculation
- Portfolio balance analysis (quick wins vs big bets)
- Quarterly roadmap generation
- Team capacity planning
- Multiple output formats (text/json/csv)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Basic prioritization
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv

# With custom team capacity (person-months per quarter)
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20

# Output as JSON for integration
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --output json
```

### customer_interview_analyzer.py
NLP-based interview analysis for extracting actionable insights.

**Capabilities**:
- Pain point extraction with severity assessment
- Feature request identification and classification
- Jobs-to-be-done pattern recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Theme extraction
- Competitor mentions
- Key quotes identification

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Analyze single interview
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py interview.txt

# Output as JSON for aggregation
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py interview.txt json
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @product-manager-toolkit to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @product-manager-toolkit against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @product-manager-toolkit for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @product-manager-toolkit using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Start with the problem, not solution
- Include clear success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Use visuals (wireframes, flows)
- Keep technical details in appendix
- Version control changes
- Mix quick wins with strategic bets

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/product-manager-toolkit`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
