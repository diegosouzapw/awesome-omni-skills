# Odoo Security Rules

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/odoo-security-rules` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Odoo Security Rules

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Setting up access rights for a new custom module.
- Restricting records so users only see their own data or their company's data.
- Debugging "Access Denied" or "You are not allowed to access" errors.
- Implementing multi-company record visibility rules.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Expert in Odoo access control: ir.model.access.csv, record rules (ir.rule), groups, and multi-company security patterns.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Security in Odoo is managed at two levels: **model-level access** (who can read/write which models) and **record-level rules** (which records a user can see). This skill helps you write correct `ir.model.access.csv` entries and `ir.rule` domain-based record rules.

#### Imported: How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-security-rules` and describe the access scenario.
2. **Generate**: Get correct CSV access lines and XML record rules.
3. **Debug**: Paste an access error and get a diagnosis with the fix.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @odoo-security-rules to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-security-rules/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/odoo-security-rules/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @odoo-security-rules using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: ir.model.access.csv

```csv
id,name,model_id:id,group_id:id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
access_hospital_patient_user,hospital.patient.user,model_hospital_patient,base.group_user,1,0,0,0
access_hospital_patient_manager,hospital.patient.manager,model_hospital_patient,base.group_erp_manager,1,1,1,1
```

> **Note:** Use `base.group_erp_manager` for ERP managers, not `base.group_system` — that group is reserved for Odoo's technical superusers. Always create a custom group for module-specific manager roles:
>
> ```xml
> <record id="group_hospital_manager" model="res.groups">
>     <field name="name">Hospital Manager</field>
>     <field name="category_id" ref="base.module_category_hidden"/>
> </record>
> ```

### Example 2: Record Rule — Users See Only Their Own Records

```xml
<record id="rule_hospital_patient_own" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Hospital Patient: Own Records Only</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_hospital_patient"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[('create_uid', '=', user.id)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('base.group_user'))]"/>
    <field name="perm_read" eval="True"/>
    <field name="perm_write" eval="True"/>
    <field name="perm_create" eval="True"/>
    <field name="perm_unlink" eval="False"/>
</record>
```

> **Important:** If you omit `<field name="groups">`, the rule becomes **global** and applies to ALL users, including admins. Always assign a group unless you explicitly intend a global restriction.

### Example 3: Multi-Company Record Rule

```xml
<record id="rule_hospital_patient_company" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Hospital Patient: Multi-Company</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_hospital_patient"/>
    <field name="domain_force">
        ['|', ('company_id', '=', False),
               ('company_id', 'in', company_ids)]
    </field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('base.group_user'))]"/>
</record>
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ✅ Do: Start with the most restrictive access and open up as needed.
- ✅ Do: Use company_ids (plural) in multi-company rules — it includes all companies the user belongs to.
- ✅ Do: Test rules using a non-admin user in debug mode — sudo() bypasses all record rules entirely.
- ✅ Do: Create dedicated security groups per module rather than reusing core Odoo groups.
- ❌ Don't: Give perm_unlink = 1 to regular users unless deletion is explicitly required by the business process.
- ❌ Don't: Leave group_id blank in ir.model.access.csv unless you intend to grant public (unauthenticated) access.
- ❌ Don't: Use base.group_system for module managers — that grants full technical access including server configurations.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/odoo-security-rules`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Limitations

- Does not cover **field-level access control** (`ir.model.fields` read/write restrictions) — those require custom OWL or Python overrides.
- **Portal and public user** access rules have additional nuances not fully covered here; test carefully with `base.group_portal`.
- Record rules are **bypassed by `sudo()`** — any code running in superuser context ignores all `ir.rule` entries.
- Does not cover **row-level security via PostgreSQL** (RLS) — Odoo manages all security at the ORM layer.
