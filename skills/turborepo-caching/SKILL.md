# Turborepo Caching

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/turborepo-caching` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Turborepo Caching Production patterns for Turborepo build optimization.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Concepts, Templates, Debugging Cache, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to turborepo caching
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Setting up new Turborepo projects
- Configuring build pipelines
- Implementing remote caching
- Optimizing CI/CD performance

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### 2. Pipeline Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **dependsOn** | Tasks that must complete first |
| **cache** | Whether to cache outputs |
| **outputs** | Files to cache |
| **inputs** | Files that affect cache key |
| **persistent** | Long-running tasks (dev servers) |

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @turborepo-caching to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/turborepo-caching/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/turborepo-caching/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @turborepo-caching using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Define explicit inputs - Avoid cache invalidation
- Use workspace protocol - "@myorg/ui": "workspace:*"
- Enable remote caching - Share across CI and local
- Filter in CI - Build only affected packages
- Cache build outputs - Not source files
- Don't cache dev servers - Use persistent: true
- Don't include secrets in env - Use runtime env vars

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Do's
- **Define explicit inputs** - Avoid cache invalidation
- **Use workspace protocol** - `"@myorg/ui": "workspace:*"`
- **Enable remote caching** - Share across CI and local
- **Filter in CI** - Build only affected packages
- **Cache build outputs** - Not source files

### Don'ts
- **Don't cache dev servers** - Use `persistent: true`
- **Don't include secrets in env** - Use runtime env vars
- **Don't ignore dependsOn** - Causes race conditions
- **Don't over-filter** - May miss dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/turborepo-caching`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Debugging Cache

```bash
# Dry run to see what would run
turbo build --dry-run

# Verbose output with hashes
turbo build --verbosity=2

# Show task graph
turbo build --graph

# Force no cache
turbo build --force

# Show cache status

```

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
