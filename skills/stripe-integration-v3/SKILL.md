# Stripe Integration

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-bundle-commerce-payments/skills/stripe-integration` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Stripe Integration Master Stripe payment processing integration for robust, PCI-compliant payment flows including checkout, subscriptions, webhooks, and refunds.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Concepts, Payment Implementation Patterns, Webhook Handling, Customer Management, Refund Handling, Testing.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to stripe integration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Implementing payment processing in web/mobile applications
- Setting up subscription billing systems
- Handling one-time payments and recurring charges
- Processing refunds and disputes

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

#### Imported: Core Concepts

### 1. Payment Flows
**Checkout Session (Hosted)**
- Stripe-hosted payment page
- Minimal PCI compliance burden
- Fastest implementation
- Supports one-time and recurring payments

**Payment Intents (Custom UI)**
- Full control over payment UI
- Requires Stripe.js for PCI compliance
- More complex implementation
- Better customization options

**Setup Intents (Save Payment Methods)**
- Collect payment method without charging
- Used for subscriptions and future payments
- Requires customer confirmation

### 2. Webhooks
**Critical Events:**
- `payment_intent.succeeded`: Payment completed
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`: Payment failed
- `customer.subscription.updated`: Subscription changed
- `customer.subscription.deleted`: Subscription canceled
- `charge.refunded`: Refund processed
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`: Subscription payment successful

### 3. Subscriptions
**Components:**
- **Product**: What you're selling
- **Price**: How much and how often
- **Subscription**: Customer's recurring payment
- **Invoice**: Generated for each billing cycle

### 4. Customer Management
- Create and manage customer records
- Store multiple payment methods
- Track customer metadata
- Manage billing details

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @stripe-integration-v3 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/stripe-integration-v3/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/stripe-integration-v3/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @stripe-integration-v3 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

```python
import stripe

stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."

# Create a checkout session
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    payment_method_types=['card'],
    line_items=[{
        'price_data': {
            'currency': 'usd',
            'product_data': {
                'name': 'Premium Subscription',
            },
            'unit_amount': 2000,  # $20.00
            'recurring': {
                'interval': 'month',
            },
        },
        'quantity': 1,
    }],
    mode='subscription',
    success_url='https://yourdomain.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
    cancel_url='https://yourdomain.com/cancel',
)

# Redirect user to session.url
print(session.url)
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always Use Webhooks: Don't rely solely on client-side confirmation
- Idempotency: Handle webhook events idempotently
- Error Handling: Gracefully handle all Stripe errors
- Test Mode: Thoroughly test with test keys before production
- Metadata: Use metadata to link Stripe objects to your database
- Monitoring: Track payment success rates and errors
- PCI Compliance: Never handle raw card data on your server

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-bundle-commerce-payments/skills/stripe-integration`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Payment Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: One-Time Payment (Hosted Checkout)
```python
def create_checkout_session(amount, currency='usd'):
    """Create a one-time payment checkout session."""
    try:
        session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
            payment_method_types=['card'],
            line_items=[{
                'price_data': {
                    'currency': currency,
                    'product_data': {
                        'name': 'Purchase',
                        'images': ['https://example.com/product.jpg'],
                    },
                    'unit_amount': amount,  # Amount in cents
                },
                'quantity': 1,
            }],
            mode='payment',
            success_url='https://yourdomain.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
            cancel_url='https://yourdomain.com/cancel',
            metadata={
                'order_id': 'order_123',
                'user_id': 'user_456'
            }
        )
        return session
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        # Handle error
        print(f"Stripe error: {e.user_message}")
        raise
```

### Pattern 2: Custom Payment Intent Flow
```python
def create_payment_intent(amount, currency='usd', customer_id=None):
    """Create a payment intent for custom checkout UI."""
    intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
        amount=amount,
        currency=currency,
        customer=customer_id,
        automatic_payment_methods={
            'enabled': True,
        },
        metadata={
            'integration_check': 'accept_a_payment'
        }
    )
    return intent.client_secret  # Send to frontend

# Frontend (JavaScript)
"""
const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_...');
const elements = stripe.elements();
const cardElement = elements.create('card');
cardElement.mount('#card-element');

const {error, paymentIntent} = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(
    clientSecret,
    {
        payment_method: {
            card: cardElement,
            billing_details: {
                name: 'Customer Name'
            }
        }
    }
);

if (error) {
    // Handle error
} else if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
    // Payment successful
}
"""
```

### Pattern 3: Subscription Creation
```python
def create_subscription(customer_id, price_id):
    """Create a subscription for a customer."""
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{'price': price_id}],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.payment_intent'],
        )

        return {
            'subscription_id': subscription.id,
            'client_secret': subscription.latest_invoice.payment_intent.client_secret
        }
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        print(f"Subscription creation failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### Pattern 4: Customer Portal
```python
def create_customer_portal_session(customer_id):
    """Create a portal session for customers to manage subscriptions."""
    session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
        customer=customer_id,
        return_url='https://yourdomain.com/account',
    )
    return session.url  # Redirect customer here
```

#### Imported: Webhook Handling

### Secure Webhook Endpoint
```python
from flask import Flask, request
import stripe

app = Flask(__name__)

endpoint_secret = 'whsec_...'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    payload = request.data
    sig_header = request.headers.get('Stripe-Signature')

    try:
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
            payload, sig_header, endpoint_secret
        )
    except ValueError:
        # Invalid payload
        return 'Invalid payload', 400
    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError:
        # Invalid signature
        return 'Invalid signature', 400

    # Handle the event
    if event['type'] == 'payment_intent.succeeded':
        payment_intent = event['data']['object']
        handle_successful_payment(payment_intent)
    elif event['type'] == 'payment_intent.payment_failed':
        payment_intent = event['data']['object']
        handle_failed_payment(payment_intent)
    elif event['type'] == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
        subscription = event['data']['object']
        handle_subscription_canceled(subscription)

    return 'Success', 200

def handle_successful_payment(payment_intent):
    """Process successful payment."""
    customer_id = payment_intent.get('customer')
    amount = payment_intent['amount']
    metadata = payment_intent.get('metadata', {})

    # Update your database
    # Send confirmation email
    # Fulfill order
    print(f"Payment succeeded: {payment_intent['id']}")

def handle_failed_payment(payment_intent):
    """Handle failed payment."""
    error = payment_intent.get('last_payment_error', {})
    print(f"Payment failed: {error.get('message')}")
    # Notify customer
    # Update order status

def handle_subscription_canceled(subscription):
    """Handle subscription cancellation."""
    customer_id = subscription['customer']
    # Update user access
    # Send cancellation email
    print(f"Subscription canceled: {subscription['id']}")
```

### Webhook Best Practices
```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    """Manually verify webhook signature."""
    expected_sig = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_sig)

def handle_webhook_idempotently(event_id, handler):
    """Ensure webhook is processed exactly once."""
    # Check if event already processed
    if is_event_processed(event_id):
        return

    # Process event
    try:
        handler()
        mark_event_processed(event_id)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
        # Stripe will retry failed webhooks
        raise
```

#### Imported: Customer Management

```python

    if reason:
        refund_params['reason'] = reason  # 'duplicate', 'fraudulent', 'requested_by_customer'

    refund = stripe.Refund.create(**refund_params)
    return refund

def handle_dispute(charge_id, evidence):
    """Update dispute with evidence."""
    stripe.Dispute.modify(
        charge_id,

            'customer_communication': evidence.get('communication'),
        }
    )
```

#### Imported: Testing

```python
# Use test mode keys
stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."

# Test card numbers
TEST_CARDS = {
    'success': '4242424242424242',

    )

    assert confirmed.status == 'succeeded'
```

#### Imported: Common Pitfalls

- **Not Verifying Webhooks**: Always verify webhook signatures
- **Missing Webhook Events**: Handle all relevant webhook events
- **Hardcoded Amounts**: Use cents/smallest currency unit
- **No Retry Logic**: Implement retries for API calls
- **Ignoring Test Mode**: Test all edge cases with test cards

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
