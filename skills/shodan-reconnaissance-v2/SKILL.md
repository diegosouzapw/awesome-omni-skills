# Shodan Reconnaissance and Pentesting

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/shodan-reconnaissance` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Shodan Reconnaissance and Pentesting

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, Inputs / Prerequisites, Outputs / Deliverables, Constraints and Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Provide systematic methodologies for leveraging Shodan as a reconnaissance tool during penetration testing engagements.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Navigate to Monitor Dashboard
2. Add IP, range, or domain to monitor
3. Configure notification service (email, Slack, webhook)
4. Select trigger events (new service, vulnerability, etc.)
5. View dashboard for exposed services
6. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
7. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.

```

#### Python Library
```python
import shodan

api = shodan.Shodan('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Search
results = api.search('apache')
print(f'Results found: {results["total"]}')
for result in results['matches']:
    print(f'IP: {result["ip_str"]}')

# Host lookup
host = api.host('1.1.1.1')
print(f'IP: {host["ip_str"]}')
print(f'Organization: {host.get("org", "n/a")}')
for item in host['data']:
    print(f'Port: {item["port"]}')
```

#### Imported: Purpose

Provide systematic methodologies for leveraging Shodan as a reconnaissance tool during penetration testing engagements. This skill covers the Shodan web interface, command-line interface (CLI), REST API, search filters, on-demand scanning, and network monitoring capabilities for discovering exposed services, vulnerable systems, and IoT devices.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @shodan-reconnaissance-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/shodan-reconnaissance-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/shodan-reconnaissance-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @shodan-reconnaissance-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Organization Reconnaissance
```bash
# Find all hosts belonging to target organization
shodan search 'org:"Target Company"'

# Get statistics on their infrastructure
shodan stats --facets port,product,country 'org:"Target Company"'

# Download detailed data
shodan download target_data.json.gz 'org:"Target Company"'

# Parse for specific info
shodan parse --fields ip_str,port,product target_data.json.gz
```

### Example 2: Vulnerable Service Discovery
```bash
# Find hosts vulnerable to BlueKeep (RDP CVE)
shodan search 'vuln:CVE-2019-0708 country:US'

# Find exposed Elasticsearch with no auth
shodan search 'product:elastic port:9200 -authentication'

# Find Log4j vulnerable systems
shodan search 'vuln:CVE-2021-44228'
```

### Example 3: IoT Device Discovery
```bash
# Find exposed webcams
shodan search 'webcam has_screenshot:true country:US'

# Find industrial control systems
shodan search 'port:502 product:modbus'

# Find exposed printers
shodan search '"HP-ChaiSOE" port:80'

# Find smart home devices
shodan search 'product:nest'
```

### Example 4: SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis
```bash
# Find hosts with specific SSL cert
shodan search 'ssl.cert.subject.cn:*.example.com'

# Find expired certificates
shodan search 'ssl.cert.expired:true org:"Company"'

# Find self-signed certificates
shodan search 'ssl.cert.issuer.cn:self-signed'
```

### Example 5: Python Automation Script
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import shodan
import json

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
api = shodan.Shodan(API_KEY)

def recon_organization(org_name):
    """Perform reconnaissance on an organization"""
    try:
        # Search for organization
        query = f'org:"{org_name}"'
        results = api.search(query)
        
        print(f"[*] Found {results['total']} hosts for {org_name}")
        
        # Collect unique IPs and ports
        hosts = {}
        for result in results['matches']:
            ip = result['ip_str']
            port = result['port']
            product = result.get('product', 'unknown')
            
            if ip not in hosts:
                hosts[ip] = []
            hosts[ip].append({'port': port, 'product': product})
        
        # Output findings
        for ip, services in hosts.items():
            print(f"\n[+] {ip}")
            for svc in services:
                print(f"    - {svc['port']}/tcp ({svc['product']})")
        
        return hosts
        
    except shodan.APIError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    recon_organization("Target Company")
```

### Example 6: Network Range Assessment
```bash
# Scan a /24 network range
shodan search 'net:192.168.1.0/24'

# Get port distribution
shodan stats --facets port 'net:192.168.1.0/24'

# Find specific vulnerabilities in range
shodan search 'net:192.168.1.0/24 vuln:CVE-2021-44228'

# Export all data for range
shodan download network_scan.json.gz 'net:192.168.1.0/24'
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/shodan-reconnaissance`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No API Key Configured | Key not initialized | Run `shodan init YOUR_API_KEY` then verify with `shodan info` |
| Query Credits Exhausted | Monthly credits consumed | Use credit-free queries (no filters), wait for reset, or upgrade |
| Host Recently Crawled | Cannot re-scan IP within 24h | Use `shodan host IP` for existing data, or wait 24 hours |
| Rate Limit Exceeded | >1 request/second | Add `time.sleep(1)` between API requests |
| Empty Search Results | Too specific or syntax error | Use quotes for phrases: `'org:"Company Name"'`; broaden criteria |
| Downloaded File Won't Parse | Corrupted or wrong format | Verify with `gunzip -t file.gz`, re-download with `--limit` |
