# Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/paywall-upgrade-cro` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO You are an expert in in-app paywalls and upgrade flows. Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they've experienced enough value to justify the commitment.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Initial Assessment, Paywall Screen Components, Specific Paywall Types, Mobile Paywall Patterns, Timing and Frequency, Upgrade Flow Optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Clear explanation of why it's paid
- Show what the feature does
- Quick path to unlock
- Option to continue without
- Clear indication of what limit was reached
- Show what upgrading provides

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Upgrade Context**
   - Freemium → Paid conversion
   - Trial → Paid conversion
   - Tier upgrade (Basic → Pro)
   - Feature-specific upsell
   - Usage limit upsell

2. **Product Model**
   - What's free forever?
   - What's behind the paywall?
   - What triggers upgrade prompts?
   - What's the current conversion rate?

3. **User Journey**
   - At what point does this appear?
   - What have they experienced already?
   - What are they trying to do when blocked?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @paywall-upgrade-cro to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @paywall-upgrade-cro against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @paywall-upgrade-cro for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @paywall-upgrade-cro using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- User should have experienced real value first
- The upgrade should feel like a natural next step
- Timing: After "aha moment," not before
- Demonstrate the value of paid features
- Preview what they're missing
- Make the upgrade feel tangible
- Easy to upgrade when ready

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/paywall-upgrade-cro`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Paywall Screen Components

### 1. Headline
Focus on what they get, not what they pay:
- "Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]"
- "Get more [value] with [Plan]"
- Not: "Upgrade to Pro for $X/month"

### 2. Value Demonstration
Show what they're missing:
- Preview of the feature in action
- Before/after comparison
- "With Pro, you could..." examples
- Specific to their use case if possible

### 3. Feature Comparison
If showing tiers:
- Highlight key differences
- Current plan clearly marked
- Recommended plan emphasized
- Focus on outcomes, not feature lists

### 4. Pricing
- Clear, simple pricing
- Annual vs. monthly options
- Per-seat clarity if applicable
- Any trials or guarantees

### 5. Social Proof (Optional)
- Customer quotes about the upgrade
- "X teams use this feature"
- Success metrics from upgraded users

### 6. CTA
- Specific: "Upgrade to Pro" not "Upgrade"
- Value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"
- If trial: "Start Free Trial"

### 7. Escape Hatch
- Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"
- Don't make them feel bad
- "Maybe later" vs. "No, I'll stay limited"
