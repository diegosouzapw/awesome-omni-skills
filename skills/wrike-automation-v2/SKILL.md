# Wrike Automation via Rube MCP

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/wrike-automation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Wrike Automation via Rube MCP Automate Wrike project management operations through Composio's Wrike toolkit via Rube MCP.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Common Patterns, Known Pitfalls.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Automate Wrike project management via Rube MCP (Composio): create tasks/folders, manage projects, assign work, and track progress. Always search tools first for current schemas.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming RUBESEARCHTOOLS responds
2. Call RUBEMANAGECONNECTIONS with toolkit wrike
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Wrike OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows
5. WRIKEGETFOLDERS - Find the target folder/project [Prerequisite]
6. WRIKEGETALLCUSTOMFIELDS - Get custom field IDs if needed [Optional]
7. WRIKECREATETASK - Create a new task [Required]

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `wrike`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Wrike OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

#### Imported: Core Workflows

### 1. Create and Manage Tasks

**When to use**: User wants to create, assign, or update tasks in Wrike

**Tool sequence**:
1. `WRIKE_GET_FOLDERS` - Find the target folder/project [Prerequisite]
2. `WRIKE_GET_ALL_CUSTOM_FIELDS` - Get custom field IDs if needed [Optional]
3. `WRIKE_CREATE_TASK` - Create a new task [Required]
4. `WRIKE_MODIFY_TASK` - Update task properties [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `folderId`: Parent folder ID where the task will be created
- `title`: Task title
- `description`: Task description (supports HTML)
- `responsibles`: Array of user IDs to assign
- `status`: 'Active', 'Completed', 'Deferred', 'Cancelled'
- `importance`: 'High', 'Normal', 'Low'
- `customFields`: Array of {id, value} objects
- `dates`: Object with type, start, due, duration

**Pitfalls**:
- folderId is required; tasks must belong to a folder
- responsibles requires Wrike user IDs, not emails or names
- Custom field IDs must be obtained from GET_ALL_CUSTOM_FIELDS
- priorityBefore and priorityAfter are mutually exclusive
- Status field may not be available on Team plan
- dates.start and dates.due use 'YYYY-MM-DD' format

### 2. Manage Folders and Projects

**When to use**: User wants to create, modify, or organize folders and projects

**Tool sequence**:
1. `WRIKE_GET_FOLDERS` - List existing folders [Required]
2. `WRIKE_CREATE_FOLDER` - Create a new folder/project [Optional]
3. `WRIKE_MODIFY_FOLDER` - Update folder properties [Optional]
4. `WRIKE_LIST_SUBFOLDERS_BY_FOLDER_ID` - List subfolders [Optional]
5. `WRIKE_DELETE_FOLDER` - Delete a folder permanently [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `folderId`: Parent folder ID for creation; target folder ID for modification
- `title`: Folder name
- `description`: Folder description
- `customItemTypeId`: Set to create as a project instead of a folder
- `shareds`: Array of user IDs or emails to share with
- `project`: Filter for projects (true) or folders (false) in GET_FOLDERS

**Pitfalls**:
- DELETE_FOLDER is permanent and removes ALL contents (tasks, subfolders, documents)
- Cannot modify rootFolderId or recycleBinId as parents
- Folder creation auto-shares with the creator
- customItemTypeId converts a folder into a project
- GET_FOLDERS with descendants=true returns folder tree (may be large)

### 3. Retrieve and Track Tasks

**When to use**: User wants to find tasks, check status, or monitor progress

**Tool sequence**:
1. `WRIKE_FETCH_ALL_TASKS` - List tasks with optional filters [Required]
2. `WRIKE_GET_TASK_BY_ID` - Get detailed info for a specific task [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `status`: Filter by task status ('Active', 'Completed', etc.)
- `dueDate`: Filter by due date range (start/end/equal)
- `fields`: Additional response fields to include
- `page_size`: Results per page (1-100)
- `taskId`: Specific task ID for detailed retrieval
- `resolve_user_names`: Auto-resolve user IDs to names (default true)

**Pitfalls**:
- FETCH_ALL_TASKS paginates at max 100 items per page
- dueDate filter supports 'equal', 'start', and 'end' fields
- Date format: 'yyyy-MM-dd' or 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'
- GET_TASK_BY_ID returns read-only detailed information
- customFields are returned by default for single task queries

### 4. Launch Task Blueprints

**When to use**: User wants to create tasks from predefined templates

**Tool sequence**:
1. `WRIKE_LIST_TASK_BLUEPRINTS` - List available blueprints [Prerequisite]
2. `WRIKE_LIST_SPACE_TASK_BLUEPRINTS` - List blueprints in a specific space [Alternative]
3. `WRIKE_LAUNCH_TASK_BLUEPRINT_ASYNC` - Launch a blueprint [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `task_blueprint_id`: ID of the blueprint to launch
- `title`: Title for the root task
- `parent_id`: Parent folder/project ID (OR super_task_id)
- `super_task_id`: Parent task ID (OR parent_id)
- `reschedule_date`: Target date for task rescheduling
- `reschedule_mode`: 'RescheduleStartDate' or 'RescheduleFinishDate'
- `entry_limit`: Max tasks to copy (1-250)

**Pitfalls**:
- Either parent_id or super_task_id is required, not both
- Blueprint launch is asynchronous; tasks may take time to appear
- reschedule_date requires reschedule_mode to be set
- entry_limit caps at 250 tasks/folders per blueprint launch
- copy_descriptions defaults to false; set true to include task descriptions

### 5. Manage Workspace and Members

**When to use**: User wants to manage spaces, members, or invitations

**Tool sequence**:
1. `WRIKE_GET_SPACE` - Get space details [Optional]
2. `WRIKE_GET_CONTACTS` - List workspace contacts/members [Optional]
3. `WRIKE_CREATE_INVITATION` - Invite a user to the workspace [Optional]
4. `WRIKE_DELETE_SPACE` - Delete a space permanently [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `spaceId`: Space identifier
- `email`: Email for invitation
- `role`: User role ('Admin', 'Regular User', 'External User')
- `firstName`/`lastName`: Invitee name

**Pitfalls**:
- DELETE_SPACE is irreversible and removes all space contents
- userTypeId and role/external are mutually exclusive in invitations
- Custom email subjects/messages require a paid Wrike plan
- GET_CONTACTS returns workspace-level contacts, not task-specific assignments

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Wrike connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `wrike`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @wrike-automation-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/wrike-automation-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/wrike-automation-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @wrike-automation-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/wrike-automation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### Folder ID Resolution

```
1. Call WRIKE_GET_FOLDERS (optionally with project=true for projects only)
2. Navigate folder tree to find target
3. Extract folder id (e.g., 'IEAGKVLFK4IHGQOI')
4. Use as folderId in task/folder creation
```

### Custom Field Setup

```
1. Call WRIKE_GET_ALL_CUSTOM_FIELDS to get definitions
2. Find field by name, extract id and type
3. Format value according to type (text, dropdown, number, date)
4. Include as {id: 'FIELD_ID', value: 'VALUE'} in customFields array
```

### Task Assignment

```
1. Call WRIKE_GET_CONTACTS to find user IDs
2. Use user IDs in responsibles array when creating tasks
3. Or use addResponsibles/removeResponsibles when modifying tasks
```

### Pagination

- FETCH_ALL_TASKS: Use page_size (max 100) and check for more results
- GET_FOLDERS: Use nextPageToken when descendants=false and pageSize is set
- LIST_TASK_BLUEPRINTS: Use next_page_token and page_size (default 100)

#### Imported: Known Pitfalls

**ID Formats**:
- Wrike IDs are opaque alphanumeric strings (e.g., 'IEAGTXR7I4IHGABC')
- Task IDs, folder IDs, space IDs, and user IDs all use this format
- Custom field IDs follow the same pattern
- Never guess IDs; always resolve from list/search operations

**Permissions**:
- Operations depend on user role and sharing settings
- Shared folders/tasks are visible only to shared users
- Admin operations require appropriate role
- Some features (custom statuses, billing types) are plan-dependent

**Deletion Safety**:
- DELETE_FOLDER removes ALL contents permanently
- DELETE_SPACE removes the entire space and contents
- Consider using MODIFY_FOLDER to move to recycle bin instead
- Restore from recycle bin is possible via MODIFY_FOLDER with restore=true

**Date Handling**:
- Dates use 'yyyy-MM-dd' format
- DateTime uses 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ' or with timezone offset
- Task dates include type ('Planned', 'Actual'), start, due, duration
- Duration is in minutes
