# Deployment Procedures

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/deployment-procedures` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Deployment Procedures > Deployment principles and decision-making for safe production releases. > Learn to THINK, not memorize scripts. ---

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill, 1. Platform Selection, 4. Post-Deployment Verification, 6. Zero-Downtime Deployment, 8. Anti-Patterns, 9. Decision Checklist.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Production deployment principles and decision-making. Safe deployment workflows, rollback strategies, and verification. Teaches thinking, not scripts.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. PREPARE
2. BACKUP
3. DEPLOY
4. VERIFY
5. CONFIRM or ROLLBACK
6. Phase - Principle
7. Prepare - Never deploy untested code

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: 3. Deployment Workflow Principles

### The 5-Phase Process

```
1. PREPARE
   └── Verify code, build, env vars

2. BACKUP
   └── Save current state before changing

3. DEPLOY
   └── Execute with monitoring open

4. VERIFY
   └── Health check, logs, key flows

5. CONFIRM or ROLLBACK
   └── All good? Confirm. Issues? Rollback.
```

### Phase Principles

| Phase | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| **Prepare** | Never deploy untested code |
| **Backup** | Can't rollback without backup |
| **Deploy** | Watch it happen, don't walk away |
| **Verify** | Trust but verify |
| **Confirm** | Have rollback trigger ready |

#### Imported: 7. Emergency Procedures

### Service Down Priority

1. **Assess**: What's the symptom?
2. **Quick fix**: Restart if unclear
3. **Rollback**: If restart doesn't help
4. **Investigate**: After stable

### Investigation Order

| Check | Common Issues |
|-------|--------------|
| **Logs** | Errors, exceptions |
| **Resources** | Disk full, memory |
| **Network** | DNS, firewall |
| **Dependencies** | Database, APIs |

#### Imported: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **deployment principles**, not bash scripts to copy.

- Every deployment is unique
- Understand the WHY behind each step
- Adapt procedures to your platform

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @deployment-procedures to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @deployment-procedures against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @deployment-procedures for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @deployment-procedures using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

#### Imported: 5. Rollback Principles

### When to Rollback

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Service down | Rollback immediately |
| Critical errors | Rollback |
| Performance >50% degraded | Consider rollback |
| Minor issues | Fix forward if quick |

### Rollback Strategy by Platform

| Platform | Rollback Method |
|----------|----------------|
| **Vercel/Netlify** | Redeploy previous commit |
| **Railway/Render** | Rollback in dashboard |
| **VPS + PM2** | Restore backup, restart |
| **Docker** | Previous image tag |
| **K8s** | kubectl rollout undo |

### Rollback Principles

1. **Speed over perfection**: Rollback first, debug later
2. **Don't compound errors**: One rollback, not multiple changes
3. **Communicate**: Tell team what happened
4. **Post-mortem**: Understand why after stable

---

#### Imported: 10. Best Practices

1. **Small, frequent deploys** over big releases
2. **Feature flags** for risky changes
3. **Automate** repetitive steps
4. **Document** every deployment
5. **Review** what went wrong after issues
6. **Test rollback** before you need it

---

> **Remember:** Every deployment is a risk. Minimize risk through preparation, not speed.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/deployment-procedures`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.



## Related Skills

- `@conductor-validator` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@confluence-automation` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@content-creator` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@content-marketer` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |
