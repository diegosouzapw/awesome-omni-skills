# UI Page

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/ui-page` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# UI Page

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How It Works, Output, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when you need a new page in a Toss-seed app
- Use when you want a consistent page shell, spacing, and navigation structure
- Use when you are adding a new product flow and need a solid starting layout
- Use when you want to stay mobile-first even if the project later expands to larger breakpoints
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Scaffold a new mobile-first page using StyleSeed Toss layout patterns, section rhythm, and existing shell components.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

Part of [StyleSeed](https://github.com/bitjaru/styleseed), this skill scaffolds a complete page or screen using the Toss seed's mobile-first composition rules. It keeps page structure consistent by building on the existing shell, top bar, bottom navigation, and card rhythm instead of producing disconnected sections.

#### Imported: How It Works

### Step 1: Inspect the Existing Shell

Read the current page scaffolding patterns first, especially:
- page shell
- top bar
- bottom navigation
- representative pages using the same route family

### Step 2: Define the Page Purpose

Clarify:
- the page name
- the primary user question the screen answers
- the top one or two actions the user should take

Every screen should have one dominant purpose.

### Step 3: Use the Information Pyramid

Lay out the page from highest importance to lowest:
1. Hero or top summary
2. KPI or key actions
3. detail cards or supporting modules
4. lists, history, or secondary content

Avoid repeating the same section type mechanically from top to bottom.

### Step 4: Apply the Toss Layout Rules

Default layout choices:
- mobile viewport width around `max-w-[430px]`
- page background on `bg-background`
- horizontal padding around `px-6`
- section rhythm with `space-y-6`
- generous bottom padding if a bottom nav is present
- cards using semantic surface tokens, rounded corners, and light shadows

### Step 5: Compose Instead of Rebuilding

Use existing `ui/` and `patterns/` components wherever possible. New pages should primarily orchestrate existing building blocks, not recreate them.

### Step 6: Account for Real Device Constraints

- handle safe-area insets
- avoid horizontal overflow
- keep interactive clusters thumb-friendly
- ensure long content scrolls cleanly without clipping the bottom navigation

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @ui-page-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/ui-page-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/ui-page-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @ui-page-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the first version structurally correct before adding decoration
- Use one strong hero instead of multiple competing highlights
- Preserve navigation consistency across sibling screens
- Prefer reusable section components when the page will likely repeat
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/ui-page`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
