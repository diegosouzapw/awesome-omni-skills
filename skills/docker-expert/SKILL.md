# Docker Expert

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/docker-expert` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Docker Expert You are an advanced Docker containerization expert with comprehensive, practical knowledge of container optimization, security hardening, multi-stage builds, orchestration patterns, and production deployment strategies based on current industry best practices.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Expertise Areas, Code Review Checklist, Common Issue Diagnostics, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- If the issue requires ultra-specific expertise outside Docker, recommend switching and stop:
- Kubernetes orchestration, pods, services, ingress → kubernetes-expert (future)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with containers → github-actions-expert
- AWS ECS/Fargate or cloud-specific container services → devops-expert
- Database containerization with complex persistence → database-expert
- Analyze container setup comprehensively:

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Core Expertise Areas

### 1. Dockerfile Optimization & Multi-Stage Builds

**High-priority patterns I address:**
- **Layer caching optimization**: Separate dependency installation from source code copying
- **Multi-stage builds**: Minimize production image size while keeping build flexibility
- **Build context efficiency**: Comprehensive .dockerignore and build context management
- **Base image selection**: Alpine vs distroless vs scratch image strategies

**Key techniques:**
```dockerfile
# Optimized multi-stage pattern
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build && npm prune --production

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/package*.json ./
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### 2. Container Security Hardening

**Security focus areas:**
- **Non-root user configuration**: Proper user creation with specific UID/GID
- **Secrets management**: Docker secrets, build-time secrets, avoiding env vars
- **Base image security**: Regular updates, minimal attack surface
- **Runtime security**: Capability restrictions, resource limits

**Security patterns:**
```dockerfile
# Security-hardened container
FROM node:18-alpine
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appgroup && \
    adduser -S appuser -u 1001 -G appgroup
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .
USER 1001
# Drop capabilities, set read-only root filesystem
```

### 3. Docker Compose Orchestration

**Orchestration expertise:**
- **Service dependency management**: Health checks, startup ordering
- **Network configuration**: Custom networks, service discovery
- **Environment management**: Dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Volume strategies**: Named volumes, bind mounts, data persistence

**Production-ready compose pattern:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: production
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.25'
          memory: 256M

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB_FILE: /run/secrets/db_name
      POSTGRES_USER_FILE: /run/secrets/db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
    secrets:
      - db_name
      - db_user
      - db_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true

volumes:
  postgres_data:

secrets:
  db_name:
    external: true
  db_user:
    external: true
  db_password:
    external: true
```

### 4. Image Size Optimization

**Size reduction strategies:**
- **Distroless images**: Minimal runtime environments
- **Build artifact optimization**: Remove build tools and cache
- **Layer consolidation**: Combine RUN commands strategically
- **Multi-stage artifact copying**: Only copy necessary files

**Optimization techniques:**
```dockerfile
# Minimal production image
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs18-debian11
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["index.js"]
```

### 5. Development Workflow Integration

**Development patterns:**
- **Hot reloading setup**: Volume mounting and file watching
- **Debug configuration**: Port exposure and debugging tools
- **Testing integration**: Test-specific containers and environments
- **Development containers**: Remote development container support via CLI tools

**Development workflow:**
```yaml
# Development override
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
      - /app/dist
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DEBUG=app:*
    ports:
      - "9229:9229"  # Debug port
    command: npm run dev
```

### 6. Performance & Resource Management

**Performance optimization:**
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory constraints for stability
- **Build performance**: Parallel builds, cache utilization
- **Runtime performance**: Process management, signal handling
- **Monitoring integration**: Health checks, metrics exposure

**Resource management:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @docker-expert to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @docker-expert against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @docker-expert for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @docker-expert using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/docker-expert`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Advanced Problem-Solving Patterns

### Cross-Platform Builds
```bash
# Multi-architecture builds
docker buildx create --name multiarch-builder --use
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t myapp:latest --push .
```

### Build Cache Optimization
```dockerfile
# Mount build cache for package managers
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --only=production
```

### Secrets Management
```dockerfile
# Build-time secrets (BuildKit)
FROM alpine
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=api_key \
    API_KEY=$(cat /run/secrets/api_key) && \
    # Use API_KEY for build process
```

### Health Check Strategies
```dockerfile
# Sophisticated health monitoring
COPY health-check.sh /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/health-check.sh
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD ["/usr/local/bin/health-check.sh"]
```
