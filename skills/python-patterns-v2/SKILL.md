# Python Patterns

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/python-patterns` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Python Patterns > Python development principles and decision-making for 2025. > Learn to THINK, not memorize patterns.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill, 1. Framework Selection (2025), 2. Async vs Sync Decision, 3. Type Hints Strategy, 7. Background Tasks, 10. Decision Checklist.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use this skill when making Python architecture decisions, choosing frameworks, designing async patterns, or structuring Python projects.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Python development principles and decision-making. Framework selection, async patterns, type hints, project structure. Teaches thinking, not copying.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: ⚠️ How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **decision-making principles**, not fixed code to copy.

- ASK user for framework preference when unclear
- Choose async vs sync based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to same framework every time

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @python-patterns-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/python-patterns-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/python-patterns-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @python-patterns-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Type - Purpose - Tools
- Unit - Business logic - pytest
- Integration - API endpoints - pytest + httpx/TestClient
- E2E - Full workflows - pytest + DB
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: 4. Project Structure Principles

### Structure Selection

```
Small project / Script:
├── main.py
├── utils.py
└── requirements.txt

Medium API:
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   └── schemas/
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml

Large application:
├── src/
│   └── myapp/
│       ├── core/
│       ├── api/
│       ├── services/
│       ├── models/
│       └── ...
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml
```

### FastAPI Structure Principles

```
Organize by feature or layer:

By layer:
├── routes/ (API endpoints)
├── services/ (business logic)
├── models/ (database models)
├── schemas/ (Pydantic models)
└── dependencies/ (shared deps)

By feature:
├── users/

#### Imported: 5. Django Principles (2025)

### Django Async (Django 5.0+)

```
Django supports async:
├── Async views
├── Async middleware
├── Async ORM (limited)
└── ASGI deployment

When to use async in Django:
├── External API calls
├── WebSocket (Channels)
├── High-concurrency views
└── Background task triggering
```

### Django Best Practices

```
Model design:
├── Fat models, thin views
├── Use managers for common queries
├── Abstract base classes for shared fields

Views:
├── Class-based for complex CRUD
├── Function-based for simple endpoints
├── Use viewsets with DRF

Queries:
├── select_related() for FKs
├── prefetch_related() for M2M
├── Avoid N+1 queries
└── Use .only() for specific fields
```

---

#### Imported: 6. FastAPI Principles

### async def vs def in FastAPI

```
Use async def when:
├── Using async database drivers
├── Making async HTTP calls
├── I/O-bound operations
└── Want to handle concurrency

Use def when:
├── Blocking operations
├── Sync database drivers
├── CPU-bound work
└── FastAPI runs in threadpool automatically
```

### Dependency Injection

```
Use dependencies for:
├── Database sessions
├── Current user / Auth
├── Configuration
├── Shared resources

Benefits:
├── Testability (mock dependencies)
├── Clean separation
├── Automatic cleanup (yield)
```

### Pydantic v2 Integration

```python
# FastAPI + Pydantic are tightly integrated:

# Request validation
@app.post("/users")
async def create(user: UserCreate) -> UserResponse:
    # user is already validated
    ...

# Response serialization
# Return type becomes response schema
```

---

#### Imported: 8. Error Handling Principles

### Exception Strategy

```
In FastAPI:
├── Create custom exception classes
├── Register exception handlers
├── Return consistent error format
└── Log without exposing internals

Pattern:
├── Raise domain exceptions in services
├── Catch and transform in handlers
└── Client gets clean error response
```

### Error Response Philosophy

```
Include:
├── Error code (programmatic)
├── Message (human readable)
├── Details (field-level when applicable)
└── NOT stack traces (security)
```

---

#### Imported: 9. Testing Principles

### Testing Strategy

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Unit** | Business logic | pytest |
| **Integration** | API endpoints | pytest + httpx/TestClient |
| **E2E** | Full workflows | pytest + DB |

### Async Testing

```python
# Use pytest-asyncio for async tests

import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_endpoint():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        response = await client.get("/users")
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Fixtures Strategy

```
Common fixtures:
├── db_session → Database connection
├── client → Test client
├── authenticated_user → User with token
└── sample_data → Test data setup
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/python-patterns`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

```
What are you building?
│
├── API-first / Microservices
│   └── FastAPI (async, modern, fast)
│
├── Full-stack web / CMS / Admin
│   └── Django (batteries-included)
│
├── Simple / Script / Learning

### Comparison Principles

| Factor | FastAPI | Django | Flask |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Best for** | APIs, microservices | Full-stack, CMS | Simple, learning |
| **Async** | Native | Django 5.0+ | Via extensions |
| **Admin** | Manual | Built-in | Via extensions |
| **ORM** | Choose your own | Django ORM | Choose your own |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | Low |

### Selection Questions to Ask:
1. Is this API-only or full-stack?
2. Need admin interface?
3. Team familiar with async?
4. Existing infrastructure?

#### Imported: 2. Async vs Sync Decision

### When to Use Async

```
async def is better when:
├── I/O-bound operations (database, HTTP, file)
├── Many concurrent connections
├── Real-time features
├── Microservices communication
└── FastAPI/Starlette/Django ASGI

def (sync) is better when:
├── CPU-bound operations
├── Simple scripts
├── Legacy codebase
├── Team unfamiliar with async
└── Blocking libraries (no async version)
```

### The Golden Rule

```
I/O-bound → async (waiting for external)
CPU-bound → sync + multiprocessing (computing)

Don't:
├── Mix sync and async carelessly
├── Use sync libraries in async code
└── Force async for CPU work
```

### Async Library Selection

| Need | Async Library |
|------|---------------|
| HTTP client | httpx |
| PostgreSQL | asyncpg |
| Redis | aioredis / redis-py async |
| File I/O | aiofiles |
| Database ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Tortoise |

---

#### Imported: 3. Type Hints Strategy

### When to Type

```
Always type:
├── Function parameters
├── Return types
├── Class attributes
├── Public APIs

Can skip:
├── Local variables (let inference work)
├── One-off scripts
├── Tests (usually)
```

### Common Type Patterns

```python
# These are patterns, understand them:

# Optional → might be None
from typing import Optional
def find_user(id: int) -> Optional[User]: ...

# Union → one of multiple types
def process(data: str | dict) -> None: ...

# Generic collections
def get_items() -> list[Item]: ...
def get_mapping() -> dict[str, int]: ...

# Callable
from typing import Callable
def apply(fn: Callable[[int], str]) -> str: ...
```

### Pydantic for Validation

```
When to use Pydantic:
├── API request/response models
├── Configuration/settings
├── Data validation
├── Serialization

Benefits:
├── Runtime validation
├── Auto-generated JSON schema
├── Works with FastAPI natively
└── Clear error messages
```

#### Imported: 7. Background Tasks

### Selection Guide

| Solution | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **BackgroundTasks** | Simple, in-process tasks |
| **Celery** | Distributed, complex workflows |
| **ARQ** | Async, Redis-based |
| **RQ** | Simple Redis queue |
| **Dramatiq** | Actor-based, simpler than Celery |

### When to Use Each

```
FastAPI BackgroundTasks:
├── Quick operations
├── No persistence needed
├── Fire-and-forget
└── Same process

Celery/ARQ:
├── Long-running tasks
├── Need retry logic
├── Distributed workers
├── Persistent queue
└── Complex workflows
```
