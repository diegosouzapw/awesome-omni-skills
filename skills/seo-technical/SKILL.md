# Technical SEO Audit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/seo-technical` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Technical SEO Audit

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Categories, Output, DataForSEO Integration (Optional), Error Handling, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the user wants a technical SEO review focused on crawlability, indexability, performance, or rendering.
- Use when auditing robots.txt, canonicalization, JavaScript SEO, Core Web Vitals, or AI crawler access.
- Use when the task is infrastructure- and implementation-oriented rather than content-focused.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Audit technical SEO across crawlability, indexability, security, URLs, mobile, Core Web Vitals, structured data, JavaScript rendering, and related platform signals like robots.txt and AI crawler access.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Categories

### 1. Crawlability
- robots.txt: exists, valid, not blocking important resources
- XML sitemap: exists, referenced in robots.txt, valid format
- Noindex tags: intentional vs accidental
- Crawl depth: important pages within 3 clicks of homepage
- JavaScript rendering: check if critical content requires JS execution
- Crawl budget: for large sites (>10k pages), efficiency matters

#### AI Crawler Management

As of 2025-2026, AI companies actively crawl the web to train models and power AI search. Managing these crawlers via robots.txt is a critical technical SEO consideration.

**Known AI crawlers:**

| Crawler | Company | robots.txt token | Purpose |
|---------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| GPTBot | OpenAI | `GPTBot` | Model training |
| ChatGPT-User | OpenAI | `ChatGPT-User` | Real-time browsing |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | `ClaudeBot` | Model training |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | `PerplexityBot` | Search index + training |
| Bytespider | ByteDance | `Bytespider` | Model training |
| Google-Extended | Google | `Google-Extended` | Gemini training (NOT search) |
| CCBot | Common Crawl | `CCBot` | Open dataset |

**Key distinctions:**
- Blocking `Google-Extended` prevents Gemini training use but does NOT affect Google Search indexing or AI Overviews (those use `Googlebot`)
- Blocking `GPTBot` prevents OpenAI training but does NOT prevent ChatGPT from citing your content via browsing (`ChatGPT-User`)
- ~3-5% of websites now use AI-specific robots.txt rules

**Example, selective AI crawler blocking:**
```
# Allow search indexing, block AI training crawlers
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /

User-agent: Bytespider
Disallow: /

# Allow all other crawlers (including Googlebot for search)
User-agent: *
Allow: /
```

**Recommendation:** Consider your AI visibility strategy before blocking. Being cited by AI systems drives brand awareness and referral traffic. Cross-reference the `seo-geo` skill for full AI visibility optimization.

### 2. Indexability
- Canonical tags: self-referencing, no conflicts with noindex
- Duplicate content: near-duplicates, parameter URLs, www vs non-www
- Thin content: pages below minimum word counts per type
- Pagination: rel=next/prev or load-more pattern
- Hreflang: correct for multi-language/multi-region sites
- Index bloat: unnecessary pages consuming crawl budget

### 3. Security
- HTTPS: enforced, valid SSL certificate, no mixed content
- Security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
- HSTS preload: check preload list inclusion for high-security sites

### 4. URL Structure
- Clean URLs: descriptive, hyphenated, no query parameters for content
- Hierarchy: logical folder structure reflecting site architecture
- Redirects: no chains (max 1 hop), 301 for permanent moves
- URL length: flag >100 characters
- Trailing slashes: consistent usage

### 5. Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design: viewport meta tag, responsive CSS
- Touch targets: minimum 48x48px with 8px spacing
- Font size: minimum 16px base
- No horizontal scroll
- Mobile-first indexing: Google indexes mobile version. **Mobile-first indexing is 100% complete as of July 5, 2024.** Google now crawls and indexes ALL websites exclusively with the mobile Googlebot user-agent.

### 6. Core Web Vitals
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): target <2.5s
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): target <200ms
  - INP replaced FID on March 12, 2024. FID was fully removed from all Chrome tools (CrUX API, PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse) on September 9, 2024. Do NOT reference FID anywhere.
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): target <0.1
- Evaluation uses 75th percentile of real user data
- Use PageSpeed Insights API or CrUX data if MCP available

### 7. Structured Data
- Detection: JSON-LD (preferred), Microdata, RDFa
- Validation against Google's supported types
- See seo-schema skill for full analysis

### 8. JavaScript Rendering
- Check if content visible in initial HTML vs requires JS
- Identify client-side rendered (CSR) vs server-side rendered (SSR)
- Flag SPA frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) that may cause indexing issues
- Verify dynamic rendering setup if applicable

#### JavaScript SEO: Canonical & Indexing Guidance (December 2025)

Google updated its JavaScript SEO documentation in December 2025 with critical clarifications:

1. **Canonical conflicts:** If a canonical tag in raw HTML differs from one injected by JavaScript, Google may use EITHER one. Ensure canonical tags are identical between server-rendered HTML and JS-rendered output.
2. **noindex with JavaScript:** If raw HTML contains `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` but JavaScript removes it, Google MAY still honor the noindex from raw HTML. Serve correct robots directives in the initial HTML response.
3. **Non-200 status codes:** Google does NOT render JavaScript on pages returning non-200 HTTP status codes. Any content or meta tags injected via JS on error pages will be invisible to Googlebot.
4. **Structured data in JavaScript:** Product, Article, and other structured data injected via JS may face delayed processing. For time-sensitive structured data (especially e-commerce Product markup), include it in the initial server-rendered HTML.

**Best practice:** Serve critical SEO elements (canonical, meta robots, structured data, title, meta description) in the initial server-rendered HTML rather than relying on JavaScript injection.

### 9. IndexNow Protocol
- Check if site supports IndexNow for Bing, Yandex, Naver
- Supported by search engines other than Google
- Recommend implementation for faster indexing on non-Google engines

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @seo-technical to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @seo-technical against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @seo-technical for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @seo-technical using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/seo-technical`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Critical Issues (fix immediately)
### High Priority (fix within 1 week)
### Medium Priority (fix within 1 month)
### Low Priority (backlog)

#### Imported: DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, use `on_page_instant_pages` for real page analysis (status codes, page timing, broken links, on-page checks), `on_page_lighthouse` for Lighthouse audits (performance, accessibility, SEO scores), and `domain_analytics_technologies_domain_technologies` for technology stack detection.

#### Imported: Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| URL unreachable | Report connection error with status code. Suggest verifying URL, checking DNS resolution, and confirming the site is publicly accessible. |
| robots.txt not found | Note that no robots.txt was detected at the root domain. Recommend creating one with appropriate directives. Continue audit on remaining categories. |
| HTTPS not configured | Flag as a critical issue. Report whether HTTP is served without redirect, mixed content exists, or SSL certificate is missing/expired. |
| Core Web Vitals data unavailable | Note that CrUX data is not available (common for low-traffic sites). Suggest using Lighthouse lab data as a proxy and recommend increasing traffic before re-testing. |

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
