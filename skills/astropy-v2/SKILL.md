# Astropy

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/astropy` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Astropy

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Additional Capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Converting between celestial coordinate systems (ICRS, Galactic, FK5, AltAz, etc.)
- Working with physical units and quantities (converting Jy to mJy, parsecs to km, etc.)
- Reading, writing, or manipulating FITS files (images or tables)
- Cosmological calculations (luminosity distance, lookback time, Hubble parameter)
- Precise time handling with different time scales (UTC, TAI, TT, TDB) and formats (JD, MJD, ISO)
- Table operations (reading catalogs, cross-matching, filtering, joining)

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

#### Imported: Overview

Astropy is the core Python package for astronomy, providing essential functionality for astronomical research and data analysis. Use astropy for coordinate transformations, unit and quantity calculations, FITS file operations, cosmological calculations, precise time handling, tabular data manipulation, and astronomical image processing.

#### Imported: Core Capabilities

### 1. Units and Quantities (`astropy.units`)

Handle physical quantities with units, perform unit conversions, and ensure dimensional consistency in calculations.

**Key operations:**
- Create quantities by multiplying values with units
- Convert between units using `.to()` method
- Perform arithmetic with automatic unit handling
- Use equivalencies for domain-specific conversions (spectral, doppler, parallax)
- Work with logarithmic units (magnitudes, decibels)

**See:** `references/units.md` for comprehensive documentation, unit systems, equivalencies, performance optimization, and unit arithmetic.

### 2. Coordinate Systems (`astropy.coordinates`)

Represent celestial positions and transform between different coordinate frames.

**Key operations:**
- Create coordinates with `SkyCoord` in any frame (ICRS, Galactic, FK5, AltAz, etc.)
- Transform between coordinate systems
- Calculate angular separations and position angles
- Match coordinates to catalogs
- Include distance for 3D coordinate operations
- Handle proper motions and radial velocities
- Query named objects from online databases

**See:** `references/coordinates.md` for detailed coordinate frame descriptions, transformations, observer-dependent frames (AltAz), catalog matching, and performance tips.

### 3. Cosmological Calculations (`astropy.cosmology`)

Perform cosmological calculations using standard cosmological models.

**Key operations:**
- Use built-in cosmologies (Planck18, WMAP9, etc.)
- Create custom cosmological models
- Calculate distances (luminosity, comoving, angular diameter)
- Compute ages and lookback times
- Determine Hubble parameter at any redshift
- Calculate density parameters and volumes
- Perform inverse calculations (find z for given distance)

**See:** `references/cosmology.md` for available models, distance calculations, time calculations, density parameters, and neutrino effects.

### 4. FITS File Handling (`astropy.io.fits`)

Read, write, and manipulate FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files.

**Key operations:**
- Open FITS files with context managers
- Access HDUs (Header Data Units) by index or name
- Read and modify headers (keywords, comments, history)
- Work with image data (NumPy arrays)
- Handle table data (binary and ASCII tables)
- Create new FITS files (single or multi-extension)
- Use memory mapping for large files
- Access remote FITS files (S3, HTTP)

**See:** `references/fits.md` for comprehensive file operations, header manipulation, image and table handling, multi-extension files, and performance considerations.

### 5. Table Operations (`astropy.table`)

Work with tabular data with support for units, metadata, and various file formats.

**Key operations:**
- Create tables from arrays, lists, or dictionaries
- Read/write tables in multiple formats (FITS, CSV, HDF5, VOTable)
- Access and modify columns and rows
- Sort, filter, and index tables
- Perform database-style operations (join, group, aggregate)
- Stack and concatenate tables
- Work with unit-aware columns (QTable)
- Handle missing data with masking

**See:** `references/tables.md` for table creation, I/O operations, data manipulation, sorting, filtering, joins, grouping, and performance tips.

### 6. Time Handling (`astropy.time`)

Precise time representation and conversion between time scales and formats.

**Key operations:**
- Create Time objects in various formats (ISO, JD, MJD, Unix, etc.)
- Convert between time scales (UTC, TAI, TT, TDB, etc.)
- Perform time arithmetic with TimeDelta
- Calculate sidereal time for observers
- Compute light travel time corrections (barycentric, heliocentric)
- Work with time arrays efficiently
- Handle masked (missing) times

**See:** `references/time.md` for time formats, time scales, conversions, arithmetic, observing features, and precision handling.

### 7. World Coordinate System (`astropy.wcs`)

Transform between pixel coordinates in images and world coordinates.

**Key operations:**
- Read WCS from FITS headers
- Convert pixel coordinates to world coordinates (and vice versa)
- Calculate image footprints
- Access WCS parameters (reference pixel, projection, scale)
- Create custom WCS objects

**See:** `references/wcs_and_other_modules.md` for WCS operations and transformations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @astropy-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/astropy-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/astropy-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @astropy-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

```python
import astropy.units as u
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
from astropy.time import Time
from astropy.io import fits
from astropy.table import Table
from astropy.cosmology import Planck18

# Units and quantities
distance = 100 * u.pc
distance_km = distance.to(u.km)

# Coordinates
coord = SkyCoord(ra=10.5*u.degree, dec=41.2*u.degree, frame='icrs')
coord_galactic = coord.galactic

# Time
t = Time('2023-01-15 12:30:00')
jd = t.jd  # Julian Date

# FITS files
data = fits.getdata('image.fits')
header = fits.getheader('image.fits')

# Tables
table = Table.read('catalog.fits')

# Cosmology
d_L = Planck18.luminosity_distance(z=1.0)
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always use units: Attach units to quantities to avoid errors and ensure dimensional consistency
- Use context managers for FITS files: Ensures proper file closing
- Prefer arrays over loops: Process multiple coordinates/times as arrays for better performance
- Check coordinate frames: Verify the frame before transformations
- Use appropriate cosmology: Choose the right cosmological model for your analysis
- Handle missing data: Use masked columns for tables with missing values
- Specify time scales: Be explicit about time scales (UTC, TT, TDB) for precise timing

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/astropy`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
