# Hugging Face API Tool Builder

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/hugging-face-tool-builder` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Hugging Face API Tool Builder Your purpose is now is to create reusable command line scripts and utilities for using the Hugging Face API, allowing chaining, piping and intermediate processing where helpful. You can access the API directly, as well as use the hf command line tool. Model and Dataset cards can be accessed from repositories directly.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Sample Scripts, High Level Endpoints, Accessing the API.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need reusable CLI scripts around the Hugging Face API or hf command line tool.
- You want shell-friendly utilities that support chaining, piping, and intermediate processing.
- You are automating repeated Hub tasks and need a composable interface instead of ad hoc API calls.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Your purpose is now is to create reusable command line scripts and utilities for using the Hugging Face API, allowing chaining, piping and intermediate processing where helpful. You can access the API directly, as well....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Sample Scripts

Paths below are relative to this skill directory.

Reference examples:
- `references/hf_model_papers_auth.sh` — uses `HF_TOKEN` automatically and chains trending → model metadata → model card parsing with fallbacks; it demonstrates multi-step API usage plus auth hygiene for gated/private content.
- `references/find_models_by_paper.sh` — optional `HF_TOKEN` usage via `--token`, consistent authenticated search, and a retry path when arXiv-prefixed searches are too narrow; it shows resilient query strategy and clear user-facing help.
- `references/hf_model_card_frontmatter.sh` — uses the `hf` CLI to download model cards, extracts YAML frontmatter, and emits NDJSON summaries (license, pipeline tag, tags, gated prompt flag) for easy filtering.

Baseline examples (ultra-simple, minimal logic, raw JSON output with `HF_TOKEN` header):
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh` — bash
- `references/baseline_hf_api.py` — python
- `references/baseline_hf_api.tsx` — typescript executable

Composable utility (stdin → NDJSON):
- `references/hf_enrich_models.sh` — reads model IDs from stdin, fetches metadata per ID, emits one JSON object per line for streaming pipelines.

Composability through piping (shell-friendly JSON output):
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh 25 | jq -r '.[].id' | references/hf_enrich_models.sh | jq -s 'sort_by(.downloads) | reverse | .[:10]'`
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh 50 | jq '[.[] | {id, downloads}] | sort_by(.downloads) | reverse | .[:10]'`
- `printf '%s\n' openai/gpt-oss-120b meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B | references/hf_model_card_frontmatter.sh | jq -s 'map({id, license, has_extra_gated_prompt})'`

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @hugging-face-tool-builder to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/hugging-face-tool-builder/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/hugging-face-tool-builder/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @hugging-face-tool-builder using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Using the HF command line tool

The `hf` command line tool gives you further access to Hugging Face repository content and infrastructure. 

```bash
❯ hf --help
Usage: hf [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Hugging Face Hub CLI

Options:
  --help                Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  auth                 Manage authentication (login, logout, etc.).
  cache                Manage local cache directory.
  download             Download files from the Hub.
  endpoints            Manage Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
  env                  Print information about the environment.
  jobs                 Run and manage Jobs on the Hub.
  repo                 Manage repos on the Hub.
  repo-files           Manage files in a repo on the Hub.
  upload               Upload a file or a folder to the Hub.
  upload-large-folder  Upload a large folder to the Hub.
  version              Print information about the hf version.
```

The `hf` CLI command has replaced the now deprecated `huggingface_hub` CLI command.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Scripts must take a --help command line argument to describe their inputs and outputs
- Non-destructive scripts should be tested before handing over to the User
- Shell scripts are preferred, but use Python or TSX if complexity or user need requires it.
- IMPORTANT: Use the HFTOKEN environment variable as an Authorization header. For example: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HFTOKEN}" https://huggingface.co/api/. This provides higher rate limits and appropriate authorization for data access.
- Investigate the shape of the API results before commiting to a final design; make use of piping and chaining where composability would be an advantage - prefer simple solutions where possible.
- Share usage examples once complete.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Script Rules

Make sure to follow these rules:
 - Scripts must take a `--help` command line argument to describe their inputs and outputs
 - Non-destructive scripts should be tested before handing over to the User
 - Shell scripts are preferred, but use Python or TSX if complexity or user need requires it.
 - IMPORTANT: Use the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable as an Authorization header. For example: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HF_TOKEN}" https://huggingface.co/api/`. This provides higher rate limits and appropriate authorization for data access.
 - Investigate the shape of the API results before commiting to a final design; make use of piping and chaining where composability would be an advantage - prefer simple solutions where possible.
 - Share usage examples once complete.

Be sure to confirm User preferences where there are questions or clarifications needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/hugging-face-tool-builder`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: High Level Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints available at `https://huggingface.co`

```
/api/datasets
/api/models
/api/spaces
/api/collections
/api/daily_papers
/api/notifications
/api/settings
/api/whoami-v2
/api/trending
/oauth/userinfo
```

#### Imported: Accessing the API

The API is documented with the OpenAPI standard at `https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json`.

**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT ATTEMPT to read `https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json` directly as it is too large to process. 

**IMPORTANT** Use `jq` to query and extract relevant parts. For example, 

 Command to Get All 160 Endpoints

```bash
curl -s "https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json" | jq '.paths | keys | sort'
```

Model Search Endpoint Details

```bash
curl -s "https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json" | jq '.paths["/api/models"]'
```

You can also query endpoints to see the shape of the data. When doing so constrain results to low numbers to make them easy to process, yet representative.
