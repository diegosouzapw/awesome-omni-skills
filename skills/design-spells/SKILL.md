# Design Spells Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/design-spells` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Design Spells Skill Design Spells is a collection of exceptional design details—micro-interactions, easter eggs, and clever UX patterns—that transform standard interfaces into memorable digital experiences.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Context.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Polishing a finished feature to actively add a "wow" factor.
- Designing unique interactions to replace standard web behaviors (e.g., clever hover states, creative loaders, surprising transitions).
- Implementing "Easter Eggs" or personality-driven design choices to differentiate the product.
- Looking to break away from generic, template-driven development.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Curated micro-interactions and design details that add "magic" and personality to websites and apps.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Identify Opportunity: Target the "boring" or "standard" parts of the interface (e.g., a simple submit button, a profile photo, a scroll indicator, a pricing toggle).
2. Research Spells: Browse Design Spells for highly creative patterns (e.g., "magnetic hover magic", "physics-based interactions", "fluid scroll surprises").
3. Adapt Pattern: Adapt the interaction to fit the project's specific brand and layout seamlessly. Use it to enhance the core narrative of the app.
4. Implement flawlessly: Use CSS, Anime.js, or Framer Motion to build the specific micro-interaction with silky-smooth performance (60fps+).
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Execution Workflow

1. **Identify Opportunity**: Target the "boring" or "standard" parts of the interface (e.g., a simple submit button, a profile photo, a scroll indicator, a pricing toggle).
2. **Research Spells**: Browse Design Spells for highly creative patterns (e.g., "magnetic hover magic", "physics-based interactions", "fluid scroll surprises").
3. **Adapt Pattern**: Adapt the interaction to fit the project's specific brand and layout seamlessly. Use it to enhance the core narrative of the app.
4. **Implement flawlessly**: Use CSS, Anime.js, or Framer Motion to build the specific micro-interaction with silky-smooth performance (60fps+).

#### Imported: Context

Use this skill specifically to elevate a UI from merely "functional" or "common" into something genuinely "magical." It focuses on the minute details that surprise and delight users, establishing a strong, premium brand personality.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @design-spells to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/design-spells/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/design-spells/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @design-spells using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- ABSOLUTE MANDATE: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build in the common style and ways. Look for every opportunity to inject "magic" into standard components.
- Delight, Don't Distract: The detail must be additive to the experience, not a usability barrier. It should feel expensive and highly crafted.
- Quality Execution: A broken or janky "spell" is worse than none. Ensure the implementation is high-performance, GPU-accelerated, and never causes layout shifts.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/design-spells`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
