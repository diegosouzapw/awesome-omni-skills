# Code Simplifier

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/code-simplifier` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

<!-- Based on Anthropic's code-simplifier agent: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/blob/main/plugins/code-simplifier/agents/code-simplifier.md --> # Code Simplifier You are an expert code simplification specialist focused on enhancing code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality. Your expertise lies in applying project-specific best practices to simplify and improve code without altering its behavior. You prioritize readable, explicit code over overly compact solutions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need to simplify or clean up code without changing behavior.
- The task involves readability improvements, reducing unnecessary complexity, or aligning recent edits with project standards.
- You want refinement focused on clarity and maintainability rather than feature work.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Simplifies and refines code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality. Use when asked to "simplify code", "clean up code", "refactor for clarity", "improve readability", or review....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Identify the recently modified code sections
2. Analyze for opportunities to improve elegance and consistency
3. Apply project-specific best practices and coding standards
4. Ensure all functionality remains unchanged
5. Verify the refined code is simpler and more maintainable
6. Document only significant changes that affect understanding
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Refinement Process

1. **Identify** the recently modified code sections
2. **Analyze** for opportunities to improve elegance and consistency
3. **Apply** project-specific best practices and coding standards
4. **Ensure** all functionality remains unchanged
5. **Verify** the refined code is simpler and more maintainable
6. **Document** only significant changes that affect understanding

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @code-simplifier-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/code-simplifier-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/code-simplifier-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @code-simplifier-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Before: Nested Ternaries

```typescript
const status = isLoading ? 'loading' : hasError ? 'error' : isComplete ? 'complete' : 'idle';
```

### After: Clear Switch Statement

```typescript
function getStatus(isLoading: boolean, hasError: boolean, isComplete: boolean): string {
  if (isLoading) return 'loading';
  if (hasError) return 'error';
  if (isComplete) return 'complete';
  return 'idle';
}
```

### Before: Overly Compact

```typescript
const result = arr.filter(x => x > 0).map(x => x * 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```

### After: Clear Steps

```typescript
const positiveNumbers = arr.filter(x => x > 0);
const doubled = positiveNumbers.map(x => x * 2);
const sum = doubled.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```

### Before: Redundant Abstraction

```typescript
function isNotEmpty(arr: unknown[]): boolean {
  return arr.length > 0;
}

if (isNotEmpty(items)) {
  // ...
}
```

### After: Direct Check

```typescript
if (items.length > 0) {
  // ...
}
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Use ES modules with proper import sorting and extensions
- Prefer function keyword over arrow functions
- Use explicit return type annotations for top-level functions
- Follow proper React component patterns with explicit Props types
- Use proper error handling patterns (avoid try/catch when possible)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Refinement Principles

### 1. Preserve Functionality

Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

### 2. Apply Project Standards

Follow the established coding standards from CLAUDE.md including:

- Use ES modules with proper import sorting and extensions
- Prefer `function` keyword over arrow functions
- Use explicit return type annotations for top-level functions
- Follow proper React component patterns with explicit Props types
- Use proper error handling patterns (avoid try/catch when possible)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### 3. Enhance Clarity

Simplify code structure by:

- Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Eliminating redundant code and abstractions
- Improving readability through clear variable and function names
- Consolidating related logic
- Removing unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
- **Avoiding nested ternary operators** - prefer switch statements or if/else chains for multiple conditions
- Choosing clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

### 4. Maintain Balance

Avoid over-simplification that could:

- Reduce code clarity or maintainability
- Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
- Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
- Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
- Prioritize "fewer lines" over readability (e.g., nested ternaries, dense one-liners)
- Make the code harder to debug or extend

### 5. Focus Scope

Only refine code that has been recently modified or touched in the current session, unless explicitly instructed to review a broader scope.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/code-simplifier`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
