# ADHX - X/Twitter Post Reader

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/adhx` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# ADHX - X/Twitter Post Reader Fetch any X/Twitter post as structured JSON for analysis using the ADHX API.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: API Endpoint, URL Patterns, Response Schema, Notes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when a user shares an X/Twitter link and wants to read, analyze, or summarize the post
- Use when you need structured data from an X/Twitter post (author, engagement, content)
- Use when working with long-form X Articles that need full content extraction
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Fetch any X/Twitter post as clean LLM-friendly JSON. Converts x.com, twitter.com, or adhx.com links into structured data with full article content, author info, and engagement metrics. No scraping or browser required.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Parse the URL to extract username and statusId from the path segments
2. Fetch the JSON using curl:
3. Use the structured response to answer the user's question (summarize, analyze, extract key points, etc.)
4. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
5. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
6. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
7. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

When a user shares an X/Twitter link:

1. **Parse the URL** to extract `username` and `statusId` from the path segments
2. **Fetch the JSON** using curl:
```bash
curl -s "https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/{username}/{statusId}"
```
3. **Use the structured response** to answer the user's question (summarize, analyze, extract key points, etc.)

#### Imported: Installation

### Option A: Claude Code plugin marketplace (recommended)
```
/plugin marketplace add itsmemeworks/adhx
```

### Option B: Manual install
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmemeworks/adhx/main/skills/adhx/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/adhx/SKILL.md
```

#### Imported: Overview

ADHX provides a free API that returns clean JSON for any X post, including full long-form article content. This is far superior to scraping or browser-based approaches for LLM consumption. Works with regular tweets and full X Articles.

#### Imported: API Endpoint

```
https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/{username}/{statusId}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @adhx to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/adhx/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/adhx/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @adhx using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Summarize a tweet

User: "Summarize this post https://x.com/dgt10011/status/2020167690560647464"

```bash
curl -s "https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/dgt10011/2020167690560647464"
```

Then use the returned JSON to provide the summary.

### Example 2: Analyze engagement

User: "How many likes did this tweet get? https://x.com/handle/status/123"

1. Parse URL: username = `handle`, statusId = `123`
2. Fetch: `curl -s "https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/handle/123"`
3. Return the `engagement.likes` value from the response

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always parse the full URL to extract username and statusId before calling the API
- Check for the article field when the user wants full content (not just tweet text)
- Use the engagement field when users ask about likes, retweets, or views
- Don't attempt to scrape x.com directly - use this API instead
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/adhx`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
