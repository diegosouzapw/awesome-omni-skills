# Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright (.NET)

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright (.NET) Management plane SDK for provisioning and managing Microsoft Playwright Testing workspaces via Azure Resource Manager. > ⚠️ Management vs Test Execution > - This SDK (Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright): Create workspaces, manage quotas, check name availability > - Test Execution SDK (Azure.Developer.MicrosoftPlaywrightTesting.NUnit): Run Playwright tests at scale on cloud browsers

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Environment Variables, Authentication, Workspace Properties, Error Handling, Integration with Test Execution, API Information.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Azure Resource Manager SDK for Microsoft Playwright Testing in .NET.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

**Current Versions**: Stable v1.0.0, Preview v1.0.0-beta.1

#### Imported: Core Workflow

### 1. Create Playwright Workspace

```csharp
using Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright.Models;

// Get resource group
var resourceGroup = await subscription
    .GetResourceGroupAsync("my-resource-group");

// Define workspace
var workspaceData = new PlaywrightWorkspaceData(AzureLocation.WestUS3)
{
    // Optional: Configure regional affinity and local auth
    RegionalAffinity = PlaywrightRegionalAffinity.Enabled,
    LocalAuth = PlaywrightLocalAuth.Enabled,
    Tags =
    {
        ["Team"] = "Dev Exp",
        ["Environment"] = "Production"
    }
};

// Create workspace (long-running operation)
var workspaceCollection = resourceGroup.Value.GetPlaywrightWorkspaces();
var operation = await workspaceCollection.CreateOrUpdateAsync(
    WaitUntil.Completed,
    "my-playwright-workspace",
    workspaceData);

PlaywrightWorkspaceResource workspace = operation.Value;

// Get the data plane URI for running tests
Console.WriteLine($"Data Plane URI: {workspace.Data.DataplaneUri}");
Console.WriteLine($"Workspace ID: {workspace.Data.WorkspaceId}");
```

### 2. Get Existing Workspace

```csharp
// Get by name
var workspace = await workspaceCollection.GetAsync("my-playwright-workspace");

// Or check if exists first
bool exists = await workspaceCollection.ExistsAsync("my-playwright-workspace");
if (exists)
{
    var existingWorkspace = await workspaceCollection.GetAsync("my-playwright-workspace");
    Console.WriteLine($"Workspace found: {existingWorkspace.Value.Data.Name}");
}
```

### 3. List Workspaces

```csharp
// List in resource group
await foreach (var workspace in workspaceCollection.GetAllAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Workspace: {workspace.Data.Name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Location: {workspace.Data.Location}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  State: {workspace.Data.ProvisioningState}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Data Plane URI: {workspace.Data.DataplaneUri}");
}

// List across subscription
await foreach (var workspace in subscription.GetPlaywrightWorkspacesAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Workspace: {workspace.Data.Name}");
}
```

### 4. Update Workspace

```csharp
var patch = new PlaywrightWorkspacePatch
{
    Tags =
    {
        ["Team"] = "Dev Exp",
        ["Environment"] = "Staging",
        ["UpdatedAt"] = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")
    }
};

var updatedWorkspace = await workspace.Value.UpdateAsync(patch);
```

### 5. Check Name Availability

```csharp
using Azure.ResourceManager.Playwright.Models;

var checkRequest = new PlaywrightCheckNameAvailabilityContent
{
    Name = "my-new-workspace",
    ResourceType = "Microsoft.LoadTestService/playwrightWorkspaces"
};

var result = await subscription.CheckPlaywrightNameAvailabilityAsync(checkRequest);

if (result.Value.IsNameAvailable == true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name is available!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name unavailable: {result.Value.Message}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Reason: {result.Value.Reason}");
}
```

### 6. Get Quota Information

```csharp
// Subscription-level quotas
await foreach (var quota in subscription.GetPlaywrightQuotasAsync(AzureLocation.WestUS3))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Quota: {quota.Data.Name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Limit: {quota.Data.Limit}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Used: {quota.Data.Used}");
}

// Workspace-level quotas
var workspaceQuotas = workspace.Value.GetAllPlaywrightWorkspaceQuota();
await foreach (var quota in workspaceQuotas.GetAllAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Workspace Quota: {quota.Data.Name}");
}
```

### 7. Delete Workspace

```csharp
// Delete (long-running operation)
await workspace.Value.DeleteAsync(WaitUntil.Completed);
```

#### Imported: Environment Variables

```bash
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your-subscription-id>
# For service principal auth (optional)
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Use WaitUntil.Completed for operations that must finish before proceeding
- Use WaitUntil.Started when you want to poll manually or run operations in parallel
- Always use DefaultAzureCredential — never hardcode keys
- Handle RequestFailedException for ARM API errors
- Use CreateOrUpdateAsync for idempotent operations
- Navigate hierarchy via Get* methods (e.g., resourceGroup.GetPlaywrightWorkspaces())
- Store the DataplaneUri after workspace creation for test execution configuration

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Best Practices

1. **Use `WaitUntil.Completed`** for operations that must finish before proceeding
2. **Use `WaitUntil.Started`** when you want to poll manually or run operations in parallel
3. **Always use `DefaultAzureCredential`** — never hardcode keys
4. **Handle `RequestFailedException`** for ARM API errors
5. **Use `CreateOrUpdateAsync`** for idempotent operations
6. **Navigate hierarchy** via `Get*` methods (e.g., `resourceGroup.GetPlaywrightWorkspaces()`)
7. **Store the DataplaneUri** after workspace creation for test execution configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/azure-resource-manager-playwright-dotnet`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
