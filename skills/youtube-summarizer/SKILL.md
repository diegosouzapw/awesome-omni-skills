# youtube-summarizer

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/youtube-summarizer` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# youtube-summarizer

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, 📝 Detailed Summary, 📚 Concepts and Terminology, 📌 Conclusion, 📊 Executive Summary, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User provides a YouTube video URL and wants a detailed summary
- User needs to document video content for reference without rewatching
- User wants to extract insights, key points, and arguments from educational content
- User needs transcripts from YouTube videos for analysis
- User asks to "summarize", "resume", or "extract content" from YouTube videos
- User wants comprehensive documentation prioritizing completeness over brevity

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `scripts/extract-transcript.py` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `scripts/install-dependencies.sh` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Step 0: Discovery & Setup

Before processing videos, validate the environment and dependencies:

```bash
# Check if youtube-transcript-api is installed
python3 -c "import youtube_transcript_api" 2>/dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  youtube-transcript-api not found"
    # Offer to install
fi

# Check Python availability
if ! command -v python3 &>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Python 3 is required but not installed"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Ask the user if dependency is missing:**

```
youtube-transcript-api is required but not installed.

Would you like to install it now?
- [ ] Yes - Install with pip (pip install youtube-transcript-api)
- [ ] No - I'll install it manually
```

**If user selects "Yes":**

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
python3 -c "import youtube_transcript_api; print('✅ youtube-transcript-api installed successfully')"
```

### Progress Tracking Guidelines

Throughout the workflow, display a visual progress gauge before each step to keep the user informed. The gauge format is:

```bash
echo "[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 20% - Step 1/5: Validating URL"
```

**Format specifications:**
- 20 characters wide (use █ for filled, ░ for empty)
- Percentage increments: Step 1=20%, Step 2=40%, Step 3=60%, Step 4=80%, Step 5=100%
- Step counter showing current/total (e.g., "Step 3/5")
- Brief description of current phase

**Display the initial status box before Step 1:**

```

### Step 1: Validate YouTube URL

**Objective:** Extract video ID and validate URL format.

**Supported URL Formats:**
- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
- `https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`

**Actions:**

```bash
# Extract video ID using regex or URL parsing
URL="$USER_PROVIDED_URL"

# Pattern 1: youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
if echo "$URL" | grep -qE 'youtube\.com/watch\?v='; then
    VIDEO_ID=$(echo "$URL" | sed -E 's/.*[?&]v=([^&]+).*/\1/')
# Pattern 2: youtu.be/VIDEO_ID
elif echo "$URL" | grep -qE 'youtu\.be/'; then
    VIDEO_ID=$(echo "$URL" | sed -E 's/.*youtu\.be\/([^?]+).*/\1/')
else
    echo "❌ Invalid YouTube URL format"
    exit 1
fi

echo "📹 Video ID extracted: $VIDEO_ID"
```

**If URL is invalid:**

```
❌ Invalid YouTube URL

Please provide a valid YouTube URL in one of these formats:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
- https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Step 2: Check Video & Transcript Availability

**Progress:**
```bash
echo "[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 40% - Step 2/5: Checking Availability"
```

**Objective:** Verify video exists and transcript is accessible.

**Actions:**

```python
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi, TranscriptsDisabled, NoTranscriptFound
import sys

video_id = sys.argv[1]

try:
    # Get list of available transcripts
    transcript_list = YouTubeTranscriptApi.list_transcripts(video_id)

    print(f"✅ Video accessible: {video_id}")
    print("📝 Available transcripts:")

    for transcript in transcript_list:
        print(f"  - {transcript.language} ({transcript.language_code})")
        if transcript.is_generated:
            print("    [Auto-generated]")

except TranscriptsDisabled:
    print(f"❌ Transcripts are disabled for video {video_id}")
    sys.exit(1)

except NoTranscriptFound:
    print(f"❌ No transcript found for video {video_id}")
    sys.exit(1)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error accessing video: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

**Error Handling:**

| Error | Message | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Video not found | "❌ Video does not exist or is private" | Ask user to verify URL |
| Transcripts disabled | "❌ Transcripts are disabled for this video" | Cannot proceed |
| No transcript available | "❌ No transcript found (not auto-generated or manually added)" | Cannot proceed |
| Private/restricted video | "❌ Video is private or restricted" | Ask for public video |

### Step 3: Extract Transcript

**Progress:**
```bash
echo "[████████████░░░░░░░░] 60% - Step 3/5: Extracting Transcript"
```

**Objective:** Retrieve transcript in preferred language.

**Actions:**

```python
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

video_id = "VIDEO_ID"

try:
    # Try to get transcript in user's preferred language first
    # Fall back to English if not available
    transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(
        video_id,
        languages=['pt', 'en']  # Prefer Portuguese, fallback to English
    )

    # Combine transcript segments into full text
    full_text = " ".join([entry['text'] for entry in transcript])

    # Get video metadata
    from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
    transcript_list = YouTubeTranscriptApi.list_transcripts(video_id)

    print("✅ Transcript extracted successfully")
    print(f"📊 Transcript length: {len(full_text)} characters")

    # Save to temporary file for processing
    with open(f"/tmp/transcript_{video_id}.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(full_text)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error extracting transcript: {e}")
    exit(1)
```

**Transcript Processing:**

- Combine all transcript segments into coherent text
- Preserve punctuation and formatting where available
- Remove duplicate or overlapping segments (if auto-generated artifacts)
- Store in temporary file for analysis

### Step 4: Generate Comprehensive Summary

**Progress:**
```bash
echo "[████████████████░░░░] 80% - Step 4/5: Generating Summary"
```

**Objective:** Apply enhanced STAR + R-I-S-E prompt to create detailed summary.

**Prompt Applied:**

Use the enhanced prompt from Phase 2 (STAR + R-I-S-E framework) with the extracted transcript as input.

**Actions:**

1. Load the full transcript text
2. Apply the comprehensive summarization prompt
3. Use AI model (Claude/GPT) to generate structured summary
4. Ensure output follows the defined structure:
   - Header with video metadata
   - Executive synthesis
   - Detailed section-by-section breakdown
   - Key insights and conclusions
   - Concepts and terminology
   - Resources and references

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Use the transcript file as input to the AI prompt
TRANSCRIPT_FILE="/tmp/transcript_${VIDEO_ID}.txt"

# The AI agent will:
# 1. Read the transcript
# 2. Apply the STAR + R-I-S-E summarization framework
# 3. Generate comprehensive Markdown output
# 4. Structure with headers, lists, and highlights

Read "$TRANSCRIPT_FILE"  # Read transcript into context
```

Then apply the full summarization prompt (from enhanced version in Phase 2).

### Step 5: Format and Present Output

**Progress:**
```bash
echo "[████████████████████] 100% - Step 5/5: Formatting Output"
```

**Objective:** Deliver the summary in clean, well-structured Markdown.

**Output Structure:**

```markdown
# [Video Title]

**Canal:** [Channel Name]
**Duração:** [Duration]
**URL:** [https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID]
**Data de Publicação:** [Date if available]

#### Imported: Purpose

This skill extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and generates comprehensive, verbose summaries using the STAR + R-I-S-E framework. It validates video availability, extracts transcripts using the `youtube-transcript-api` Python library, and produces detailed documentation capturing all insights, arguments, and key points.

The skill is designed for users who need thorough content analysis and reference documentation from educational videos, lectures, tutorials, or informational content.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @youtube-summarizer to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @youtube-summarizer against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @youtube-summarizer for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @youtube-summarizer using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/youtube-summarizer`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
