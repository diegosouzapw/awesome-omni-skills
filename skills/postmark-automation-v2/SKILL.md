# Postmark Automation via Rube MCP

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/postmark-automation` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Postmark Automation via Rube MCP Automate Postmark transactional email operations through Composio's Postmark toolkit via Rube MCP.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Common Patterns, Known Pitfalls.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Automate Postmark email delivery tasks via Rube MCP (Composio): send templated emails, manage templates, monitor delivery stats and bounces. Always search tools first for current schemas.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming RUBESEARCHTOOLS responds
2. Call RUBEMANAGECONNECTIONS with toolkit postmark
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Postmark authentication
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows
5. POSTMARKLISTTEMPLATES - Find available templates and their IDs [Prerequisite]
6. POSTMARKVALIDATETEMPLATE - Validate template with model data before sending [Optional]
7. POSTMARKSENDBATCHWITHTEMPLATES - Send batch emails using a template [Required]

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `postmark`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Postmark authentication
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

#### Imported: Core Workflows

### 1. Send Templated Batch Emails

**When to use**: User wants to send templated emails to multiple recipients in one call

**Tool sequence**:
1. `POSTMARK_LIST_TEMPLATES` - Find available templates and their IDs [Prerequisite]
2. `POSTMARK_VALIDATE_TEMPLATE` - Validate template with model data before sending [Optional]
3. `POSTMARK_SEND_BATCH_WITH_TEMPLATES` - Send batch emails using a template [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `TemplateId` or `TemplateAlias`: Identifier for the template to use
- `Messages`: Array of message objects with `From`, `To`, `TemplateModel`
- `TemplateModel`: Key-value pairs matching template variables

**Pitfalls**:
- Maximum 500 messages per batch call
- Either `TemplateId` or `TemplateAlias` is required, not both
- `TemplateModel` keys must match template variable names exactly (case-sensitive)
- Sender address must be a verified Sender Signature or from a verified domain

### 2. Manage Email Templates

**When to use**: User wants to create, edit, or inspect email templates

**Tool sequence**:
1. `POSTMARK_LIST_TEMPLATES` - List all templates with IDs and names [Required]
2. `POSTMARK_GET_TEMPLATE` - Get full template details including HTML/text body [Optional]
3. `POSTMARK_EDIT_TEMPLATE` - Update template content or settings [Optional]
4. `POSTMARK_VALIDATE_TEMPLATE` - Test template rendering with sample data [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `TemplateId`: Numeric template ID for GET/EDIT operations
- `Name`: Template display name
- `Subject`: Email subject line (supports template variables)
- `HtmlBody`: HTML content of the template
- `TextBody`: Plain text fallback content
- `TemplateType`: 'Standard' or 'Layout'

**Pitfalls**:
- Template IDs are numeric integers, not strings
- Editing a template replaces the entire content; include all fields you want to keep
- Layout templates wrap Standard templates; changing a layout affects all linked templates
- Validate before sending to catch missing variables early

### 3. Monitor Delivery Statistics

**When to use**: User wants to check email delivery health, open/click rates, or outbound overview

**Tool sequence**:
1. `POSTMARK_GET_DELIVERY_STATS` - Get bounce counts by type [Required]
2. `POSTMARK_GET_OUTBOUND_OVERVIEW` - Get sent/opened/clicked/bounced summary [Required]
3. `POSTMARK_GET_TRACKED_EMAIL_COUNTS` - Get tracked email volume over time [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `fromdate`: Start date for filtering stats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `todate`: End date for filtering stats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `tag`: Filter stats by message tag
- `messagestreamid`: Filter by message stream (e.g., 'outbound', 'broadcast')

**Pitfalls**:
- Date parameters use YYYY-MM-DD format without time component
- Stats are aggregated; individual message tracking requires separate API calls
- `messagestreamid` defaults to all streams if not specified

### 4. Manage Bounces and Complaints

**When to use**: User wants to review bounced emails or spam complaints

**Tool sequence**:
1. `POSTMARK_GET_BOUNCES` - List bounced messages with details [Required]
2. `POSTMARK_GET_SPAM_COMPLAINTS` - List spam complaint records [Optional]
3. `POSTMARK_GET_DELIVERY_STATS` - Get bounce summary counts [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `count`: Number of records to return per page
- `offset`: Pagination offset for results
- `type`: Bounce type filter (e.g., 'HardBounce', 'SoftBounce', 'SpamNotification')
- `fromdate`/`todate`: Date range filters
- `emailFilter`: Filter by recipient email address

**Pitfalls**:
- Bounce types include: HardBounce, SoftBounce, SpamNotification, SpamComplaint, Transient, and others
- Hard bounces indicate permanent delivery failures; these addresses should be removed
- Spam complaints affect sender reputation; monitor regularly
- Pagination uses `count` and `offset`, not page tokens

### 5. Configure Server Settings

**When to use**: User wants to view or modify Postmark server configuration

**Tool sequence**:
1. `POSTMARK_GET_SERVER` - Retrieve current server settings [Required]
2. `POSTMARK_EDIT_SERVER` - Update server configuration [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `Name`: Server display name
- `SmtpApiActivated`: Enable/disable SMTP API access
- `BounceHookUrl`: Webhook URL for bounce notifications
- `InboundHookUrl`: Webhook URL for inbound email processing
- `TrackOpens`: Enable/disable open tracking
- `TrackLinks`: Link tracking mode ('None', 'HtmlAndText', 'HtmlOnly', 'TextOnly')

**Pitfalls**:
- Server edits affect all messages sent through that server
- Webhook URLs must be publicly accessible HTTPS endpoints
- Changing `SmtpApiActivated` affects SMTP relay access immediately
- Track settings apply to future messages only, not retroactively

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Postmark connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `postmark`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @postmark-automation-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/postmark-automation-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/postmark-automation-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @postmark-automation-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/postmark-automation`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Common Patterns

### Template Variable Resolution

```
1. Call POSTMARK_GET_TEMPLATE with TemplateId
2. Inspect HtmlBody/TextBody for {{variable}} placeholders
3. Build TemplateModel dict with matching keys
4. Call POSTMARK_VALIDATE_TEMPLATE to verify rendering
```

### Pagination

- Set `count` for results per page (varies by endpoint)
- Use `offset` to skip previously fetched results
- Increment offset by count each page until results returned < count
- Total records may be returned in response metadata

#### Imported: Known Pitfalls

**Authentication**:
- Postmark uses server-level API tokens, not account-level
- Each server has its own token; ensure correct server context
- Sender addresses must be verified Sender Signatures or from verified domains

**Rate Limits**:
- Batch send limited to 500 messages per call
- API rate limits vary by endpoint; implement backoff on 429 responses

**Response Parsing**:
- Response data may be nested under `data` or `data.data`
- Parse defensively with fallback patterns
- Template IDs are always numeric integers
