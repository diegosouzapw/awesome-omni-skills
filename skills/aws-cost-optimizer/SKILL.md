# AWS Cost Optimizer

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/aws-cost-optimizer` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# AWS Cost Optimizer Analyze AWS spending patterns, identify waste, and provide actionable cost reduction strategies.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Cost Optimization Checklist, Integration with Kiro CLI, Safety Notes, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use this skill when you need to analyze AWS spending, identify cost optimization opportunities, or reduce cloud waste.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Comprehensive AWS cost analysis and optimization recommendations using AWS CLI and Cost Explorer.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Baseline Assessment
2. Pull 3-6 months of cost data
3. Identify top 5 spending services
4. Calculate growth rate
5. Quick Wins
6. Delete unattached EBS volumes
7. Release unused Elastic IPs

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Optimization Workflow

1. **Baseline Assessment**
   - Pull 3-6 months of cost data
   - Identify top 5 spending services
   - Calculate growth rate

2. **Quick Wins**
   - Delete unattached EBS volumes
   - Release unused Elastic IPs
   - Stop/terminate idle EC2 instances
   - Delete old snapshots

3. **Strategic Optimization**
   - Analyze Reserved Instance coverage

- Identify month-over-month spending increases

**Resource Optimization**
- Detect idle EC2 instances (low CPU utilization)
- Find unattached EBS volumes and old snapshots

- Find old S3 objects eligible for lifecycle policies

**Savings Recommendations**
- Suggest Reserved Instance/Savings Plans opportunities

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @aws-cost-optimizer to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @aws-cost-optimizer against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @aws-cost-optimizer for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @aws-cost-optimizer using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: AWS CLI Commands

### Get Cost and Usage
```bash
# Last 30 days cost by service
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=$(date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE

# Daily costs for current month
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=$(date +%Y-%m-01),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics UnblendedCost
```

### Find Unused Resources
```bash
# Unattached EBS volumes
aws ec2 describe-volumes \
  --filters Name=status,Values=available \
  --query 'Volumes[*].[VolumeId,Size,VolumeType,CreateTime]' \
  --output table

# Unused Elastic IPs
aws ec2 describe-addresses \
  --query 'Addresses[?AssociationId==null].[PublicIp,AllocationId]' \
  --output table

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-xxxxx \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 86400 \

# List EC2 instances with their types
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,InstanceType,State.Name,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' \
  --output table

# Get RDS instance utilization
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/RDS \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=DBInstanceIdentifier,Value=mydb \

  --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 86400 \
  --statistics Average,Maximum
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Always test in non-production first
- Verify resources are truly unused before deletion
- Document all cost optimization actions
- Calculate ROI for optimization efforts
- Automate recurring optimization tasks
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor recommendations
- Enable AWS Cost Anomaly Detection

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/aws-cost-optimizer`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
