# SwiftUI View Refactor

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/swiftui-view-refactor` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# SwiftUI View Refactor

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Notes, Large-view handling, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- When cleaning up a large SwiftUI view or splitting long body implementations.
- When you need smaller subviews, explicit dependency injection, or better Observation usage.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Refactor SwiftUI views into smaller components with stable, explicit data flow.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `references/mv-patterns.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `agents/openai.yaml` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Reorder the view to match the ordering rules.
2. Remove inline actions and side effects from body; move business logic into services/models and keep only thin orchestration in the view.
3. Shorten long bodies by extracting dedicated subview types; avoid rebuilding the screen out of many computed some View helpers.
4. Ensure stable view structure: avoid top-level if-based branch swapping; move conditions to localized sections/modifiers.
5. If a view model exists or is explicitly required, replace optional view models with a non-optional @State view model initialized in init.
6. Confirm Observation usage: @State for root @Observable models on iOS 17+, legacy wrappers only when the deployment target requires them.
7. Keep behavior intact: do not change layout or business logic unless requested.

### Imported Workflow Notes

3. Shorten long bodies by extracting dedicated subview types; avoid rebuilding the screen out of many computed `some View` helpers.
4. Ensure stable view structure: avoid top-level `if`-based branch swapping; move conditions to localized sections/modifiers.
5. If a view model exists or is explicitly required, replace optional view models with a non-optional `@State` view model initialized in `init`.
6. Confirm Observation usage: `@State` for root `@Observable` models on iOS 17+, legacy wrappers only when the deployment target requires them.
7. Keep behavior intact: do not change layout or business logic unless requested.

#### Imported: Overview

Refactor SwiftUI views toward small, explicit, stable view types. Default to vanilla SwiftUI: local state in the view, shared dependencies in the environment, business logic in services/models, and view models only when the request or existing code clearly requires one.

#### Imported: Notes

- Prefer small, explicit view types over large conditional blocks and large computed `some View` properties.
- Keep computed view builders below `body` and non-view computed vars above `init`.
- A good SwiftUI refactor should make the view read top-to-bottom as data flow plus layout, not as mixed layout and imperative logic.
- For MV-first guidance and rationale, see `references/mv-patterns.md`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @swiftui-view-refactor to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @swiftui-view-refactor against EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @swiftui-view-refactor for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @swiftui-view-refactor using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Enforce this ordering unless the existing file has a stronger local convention you must preserve.
- Environment
- private/public let
- @State / other stored properties
- computed var (non-view)
- init
- body

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Core Guidelines

### 1) View ordering (top → bottom)
- Enforce this ordering unless the existing file has a stronger local convention you must preserve.
- Environment
- `private`/`public` `let`
- `@State` / other stored properties
- computed `var` (non-view)
- `init`
- `body`
- computed view builders / other view helpers
- helper / async functions

### 2) Default to MV, not MVVM
- Views should be lightweight state expressions and orchestration points, not containers for business logic.
- Favor `@State`, `@Environment`, `@Query`, `.task`, `.task(id:)`, and `onChange` before reaching for a view model.
- Inject services and shared models via `@Environment`; keep domain logic in services/models, not in the view body.
- Do not introduce a view model just to mirror local view state or wrap environment dependencies.
- If a screen is getting large, split the UI into subviews before inventing a new view model layer.

### 3) Strongly prefer dedicated subview types over computed `some View` helpers
- Flag `body` properties that are longer than roughly one screen or contain multiple logical sections.
- Prefer extracting dedicated `View` types for non-trivial sections, especially when they have state, async work, branching, or deserve their own preview.
- Keep computed `some View` helpers rare and small. Do not build an entire screen out of `private var header: some View`-style fragments.
- Pass small, explicit inputs (data, bindings, callbacks) into extracted subviews instead of handing down the entire parent state.
- If an extracted subview becomes reusable or independently meaningful, move it to its own file.

Prefer:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        HeaderSection(title: title, subtitle: subtitle)
        FilterSection(
            filterOptions: filterOptions,
            selectedFilter: $selectedFilter
        )
        ResultsSection(items: filteredItems)
        FooterSection()
    }
}

private struct HeaderSection: View {
    let title: String
    let subtitle: String

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
            Text(title).font(.title2)
            Text(subtitle).font(.subheadline)
        }
    }
}

private struct FilterSection: View {
    let filterOptions: [FilterOption]
    @Binding var selectedFilter: FilterOption

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(filterOptions, id: \.self) { option in
                    FilterChip(option: option, isSelected: option == selectedFilter)
                        .onTapGesture { selectedFilter = option }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Avoid:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        header
        filters
        results
        footer
    }
}

private var header: some View {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 6) {
        Text(title).font(.title2)
        Text(subtitle).font(.subheadline)
    }
}
```

### 3b) Extract actions and side effects out of `body`
- Do not keep non-trivial button actions inline in the view body.
- Do not bury business logic inside `.task`, `.onAppear`, `.onChange`, or `.refreshable`.
- Prefer calling small private methods from the view, and move real business logic into services/models.
- The body should read like UI, not like a view controller.

```swift
Button("Save", action: save)
    .disabled(isSaving)

.task(id: searchText) {
    await reload(for: searchText)
}

private func save() {
    Task { await saveAsync() }
}

private func reload(for searchText: String) async {
    guard !searchText.isEmpty else {
        results = []
        return
    }
    await searchService.search(searchText)
}
```

### 4) Keep a stable view tree (avoid top-level conditional view swapping)
- Avoid `body` or computed views that return completely different root branches via `if/else`.
- Prefer a single stable base view with conditions inside sections/modifiers (`overlay`, `opacity`, `disabled`, `toolbar`, etc.).
- Root-level branch swapping causes identity churn, broader invalidation, and extra recomputation.

Prefer:

```swift
var body: some View {
    List {
        documentsListContent
    }
    .toolbar {
        if canEdit {
            editToolbar
        }
    }
}
```

Avoid:

```swift
var documentsListView: some View {
    if canEdit {
        editableDocumentsList
    } else {
        readOnlyDocumentsList
    }
}
```

### 5) View model handling (only if already present or explicitly requested)
- Treat view models as a legacy or explicit-need pattern, not the default.
- Do not introduce a view model unless the request or existing code clearly calls for one.
- If a view model exists, make it non-optional when possible.
- Pass dependencies to the view via `init`, then create the view model in the view's `init`.
- Avoid `bootstrapIfNeeded` patterns and other delayed setup workarounds.

Example (Observation-based):

```swift
@State private var viewModel: SomeViewModel

init(dependency: Dependency) {
    _viewModel = State(initialValue: SomeViewModel(dependency: dependency))
}
```

### 6) Observation usage
- For `@Observable` reference types on iOS 17+, store them as `@State` in the owning view.
- Pass observables down explicitly; avoid optional state unless the UI genuinely needs it.
- If the deployment target includes iOS 16 or earlier, use `@StateObject` at the owner and `@ObservedObject` when injecting legacy observable models.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/swiftui-view-refactor`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `EXTERNAL_SOURCE.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Load only the files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Large-view handling

When a SwiftUI view file exceeds ~300 lines, split it aggressively. Extract meaningful sections into dedicated `View` types instead of hiding complexity in many computed properties. Use `private` extensions with `// MARK: -` comments for actions and helpers, but do not treat extensions as a substitute for breaking a giant screen into smaller view types. If an extracted subview is reused or independently meaningful, move it into its own file.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
